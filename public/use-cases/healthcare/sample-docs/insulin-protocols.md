# Insulin Therapy Protocols

**Document ID:** CG-ENDO-2025-007
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Department:** Endocrinology / Internal Medicine
**Classification:** Clinical Guideline

## 1. Indications for Insulin Therapy

Insulin therapy should be initiated in patients with Type 2 diabetes when: HbA1c remains above target despite maximum tolerated doses of two or more oral agents, HbA1c is greater than 10% at diagnosis (consider early insulin), symptomatic hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss), or when oral agents are contraindicated (advanced CKD, hepatic impairment).

## 2. Basal Insulin Initiation

### 2.1 Starting Dose

Start with 10 units at bedtime (or 0.1 to 0.2 units/kg/day, whichever is lower). Preferred agents: insulin glargine (Lantus, Basaglar) or insulin degludec (Tresiba).

### 2.2 Titration Protocol (Fasting Glucose-Based)

Adjust basal insulin dose every 3 to 4 days based on fasting blood glucose:

| Fasting Glucose (mg/dL) | Dose Adjustment |
|---|---|
| Greater than 180 | Increase by 4 units |
| 130 to 180 | Increase by 2 units |
| 80 to 130 | No change (at target) |
| 54 to 79 | Decrease by 2 units |
| Less than 54 | Decrease by 4 units, investigate cause |

Continue titrating until fasting glucose is consistently 80 to 130 mg/dL. If total basal dose exceeds 0.5 units/kg/day and postprandial glucose is elevated, consider adding prandial insulin.

## 3. Basal-Bolus (Multiple Daily Injections) Protocol

### 3.1 When to Initiate

Add prandial insulin when basal insulin alone is insufficient: fasting glucose at target but HbA1c remains above goal (indicating postprandial hyperglycemia), or total daily basal dose exceeds 0.5 units/kg.

### 3.2 Dosing

**Total daily dose (TDD):** 0.3 to 0.5 units/kg/day for insulin-naive patients, distributed as 50% basal and 50% prandial.

**Prandial insulin:** Rapid-acting insulin (lispro, aspart, or glulisine) given 0 to 15 minutes before each meal. Divide prandial portion equally among three meals initially, then adjust based on postprandial glucose readings.

**Correction factor:** For postprandial readings above target, apply correction factor. Correction factor = 1800 / TDD (gives the expected glucose drop per 1 unit of rapid-acting insulin). Example: TDD 60 units, correction factor = 1800/60 = 30 mg/dL per unit.

### 3.3 Adjustment

Adjust prandial doses based on 2-hour postprandial glucose. Target: less than 180 mg/dL. Adjust the dose for the meal preceding the elevated reading.

## 4. Sliding Scale Insulin (Inpatient)

Sliding scale insulin alone is not recommended as the sole method of glycemic management in hospitalized patients. It should be used as a supplement to a scheduled basal-bolus regimen.

**Inpatient targets:** General ward: 140 to 180 mg/dL. ICU: 140 to 180 mg/dL (avoid tight control below 110 due to hypoglycemia risk).

### Supplemental Correction Scale (General Ward)

| Blood Glucose (mg/dL) | Low Dose | Medium Dose | High Dose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 150 to 199 | 1 unit | 2 units | 3 units |
| 200 to 249 | 2 units | 4 units | 6 units |
| 250 to 299 | 3 units | 6 units | 9 units |
| 300 to 349 | 4 units | 8 units | 12 units |
| Greater than 350 | 5 units + notify MD | 10 units + notify MD | 14 units + notify MD |

Assign dose intensity based on total daily insulin requirement: low dose (TDD less than 40 units or insulin-naive), medium dose (TDD 40 to 80 units), high dose (TDD greater than 80 units).

## 5. Transition from IV to Subcutaneous Insulin

For patients on continuous IV insulin infusion transitioning to subcutaneous:

1. Calculate the average hourly insulin infusion rate over the last 6 to 8 hours (stable period)
2. Multiply by 24 to estimate total daily requirement
3. Reduce by 20% for safety margin
4. Divide: 50% as basal insulin, 50% as prandial insulin divided among three meals
5. Administer the first dose of subcutaneous basal insulin 2 hours before discontinuing the IV infusion (for glargine) or simultaneously (for degludec)
6. Monitor blood glucose every 4 to 6 hours for the first 24 hours after transition

## 6. Hypoglycemia Management

**Level 1 (glucose 54 to 70 mg/dL, alert value):** Administer 15 to 20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate. Recheck in 15 minutes. Repeat if still below 70.

**Level 2 (glucose less than 54 mg/dL, serious):** Same as Level 1 if patient is conscious and able to swallow. If unable to take oral carbohydrate: glucagon 1 mg IM/SC, or dextrose 50% 25 mL IV push.

**Level 3 (severe, altered mental status or seizure):** Glucagon 1 mg IM or IV dextrose 50%. Notify physician immediately. Continuous glucose monitoring for at least 24 hours.

Review insulin regimen after any Level 2 or Level 3 event. Reduce the responsible insulin dose by at least 20%.
