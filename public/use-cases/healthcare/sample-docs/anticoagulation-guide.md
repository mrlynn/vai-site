**Document ID:** CG-HEME-2025-001
**Effective Date:** February 1, 2025
**Review Date:** February 1, 2026
**Department:** Hematology, Pharmacy, Internal Medicine
**Approved By:** Anticoagulation Stewardship Committee

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This guide provides standardized recommendations for the selection, dosing, monitoring, and reversal of anticoagulation therapy. It applies to adult patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism (VTE), mechanical heart valves, and other indications requiring systemic anticoagulation.

## 2. Indication-Based Selection

### 2.1 Atrial Fibrillation (Non-Valvular)

Calculate CHA2DS2-VASc score for all patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation:

| Risk Factor | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Congestive heart failure | 1 |
| Hypertension | 1 |
| Age 75 or older | 2 |
| Diabetes mellitus | 1 |
| Stroke/TIA/thromboembolism | 2 |
| Vascular disease | 1 |
| Age 65-74 | 1 |
| Sex category (female) | 1 |

- Score of 0 (males) or 1 (females): Anticoagulation generally not recommended
- Score of 1 (males): Consider anticoagulation based on individual risk-benefit assessment
- Score of 2 or greater: Anticoagulation is recommended

**Preferred agents:** DOACs are preferred over warfarin for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, unless contraindicated.

### 2.2 Venous Thromboembolism (DVT/PE)

- DOACs are first-line for most patients with VTE
- Warfarin with LMWH bridging remains appropriate when DOACs are contraindicated
- Duration: Provoked VTE requires 3 months minimum; unprovoked VTE requires extended therapy with periodic reassessment

### 2.3 Mechanical Heart Valves

- Warfarin is the only approved anticoagulant. DOACs are contraindicated.
- Target INR: 2.5-3.5 for mitral mechanical valves; 2.0-3.0 for aortic mechanical valves

## 3. DOAC Dosing

### 3.1 Apixaban (Eliquis)

- Atrial fibrillation: 5 mg BID; reduce to 2.5 mg BID if patient meets 2 of 3 criteria: age 80 or older, weight 60 kg or less, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater
- VTE treatment: 10 mg BID for 7 days, then 5 mg BID
- No dose adjustment needed for renal impairment alone down to CrCl 15 mL/min
- Preferred agent in patients with renal insufficiency

### 3.2 Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)

- Atrial fibrillation: 20 mg daily with the evening meal; reduce to 15 mg daily with the evening meal if CrCl 15-50 mL/min
- VTE treatment: 15 mg BID with food for 21 days, then 20 mg daily with food
- Must be taken with food for adequate absorption

### 3.3 Dabigatran (Pradaxa)

- Atrial fibrillation: 150 mg BID; reduce to 75 mg BID if CrCl 15-30 mL/min
- VTE treatment: 150 mg BID after 5-10 days of parenteral anticoagulation
- Avoid if CrCl less than 15 mL/min
- Store in original packaging; discard 4 months after opening the bottle

### 3.4 Edoxaban (Savaysa)

- Atrial fibrillation: 60 mg daily; reduce to 30 mg daily if CrCl 15-50 mL/min, body weight 60 kg or less, or concurrent use of certain P-glycoprotein inhibitors
- Do not use if CrCl greater than 95 mL/min (reduced efficacy)
- VTE treatment: 60 mg daily after 5-10 days of parenteral anticoagulation

## 4. Warfarin Management

### 4.1 Initiation

- Starting dose: 5 mg daily for most patients
- Reduced starting dose (2.5 mg daily) for patients who are elderly, malnourished, have hepatic impairment, or are on interacting medications
- Check INR on day 3, adjust accordingly

### 4.2 Target INR Ranges

| Indication | Target INR |
|------------|-----------|
| Non-valvular atrial fibrillation | 2.0-3.0 |
| VTE treatment/prevention | 2.0-3.0 |
| Mechanical aortic valve | 2.0-3.0 |
| Mechanical mitral valve | 2.5-3.5 |

### 4.3 INR Monitoring

- Check INR at least weekly during initiation until stable
- Once stable (two consecutive INRs in range, same dose), extend to every 2-4 weeks
- Recheck within 1 week of any medication change, dietary change, or acute illness

## 5. Periprocedural Management

### 5.1 When to Hold Anticoagulation

| Agent | Time to Hold Before Procedure |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Warfarin | 5 days (check INR day of procedure, target less than 1.5) |
| Apixaban | 48 hours (72 hours if CrCl less than 25 mL/min) |
| Rivaroxaban | 48 hours (72 hours if CrCl less than 30 mL/min) |
| Dabigatran | 48-72 hours (96 hours if CrCl less than 50 mL/min) |
| Edoxaban | 48 hours |

For procedures with minimal bleeding risk (cataract surgery, minor dental procedures, superficial skin procedures), anticoagulation may be continued.

### 5.2 Bridging Anticoagulation

Bridging with LMWH or unfractionated heparin is considered for patients on warfarin who are at high thromboembolic risk:

- High risk: Mechanical mitral valve, recent stroke or TIA within 3 months, CHA2DS2-VASc score of 7 or greater
- Low risk: Non-valvular afib without recent stroke, CHA2DS2-VASc score less than 5
- Bridging is generally not recommended for low-risk patients (BRIDGE trial data)
- DOACs do not require bridging due to rapid onset and offset of action

## 6. Reversal Agents

### 6.1 Dabigatran Reversal

- **Idarucizumab (Praxbind):** 5 g IV (given as two 2.5 g doses no more than 15 minutes apart)
- Provides complete reversal within minutes
- Indicated for life-threatening bleeding or emergent surgery

### 6.2 Factor Xa Inhibitor Reversal (Apixaban, Rivaroxaban)

- **Andexanet alfa (Andexxa):** Dosing depends on the specific agent, dose, and timing of the last dose
  - Low dose: 400 mg IV bolus at 30 mg/min, followed by 4 mg/min infusion for up to 120 minutes
  - High dose: 800 mg IV bolus at 30 mg/min, followed by 8 mg/min infusion for up to 120 minutes
- Monitor for thromboembolic events post-reversal

### 6.3 Warfarin Reversal

- **Vitamin K (Phytonadione):** 2.5-10 mg IV or oral depending on urgency and degree of INR elevation
- **4-Factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (4F-PCC, Kcentra):** For major or life-threatening bleeding
  - Dosing based on INR: INR 2-4 gives 25 units/kg; INR 4-6 gives 35 units/kg; INR greater than 6 gives 50 units/kg
  - Maximum dose 2500 units
- 4F-PCC can also be used for Factor Xa inhibitor reversal when andexanet alfa is unavailable (off-label, 50 units/kg)

## 7. Monitoring and Follow-Up

- All patients on anticoagulation should have documented indication, planned duration, and follow-up interval
- Assess renal function at baseline and at least annually (more frequently for DOACs in renal impairment)
- Evaluate for bleeding at every encounter using the HAS-BLED score
- Provide patient education on signs of bleeding, dietary considerations (for warfarin), and drug interactions
