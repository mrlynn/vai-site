# Hospital Discharge Protocol and Checklist

**Document ID:** CG-QS-2025-001
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Department:** Quality and Safety / Care Transitions
**Classification:** Clinical Guideline

## 1. Purpose

This protocol standardizes the hospital discharge process to reduce preventable readmissions, improve medication safety, and ensure continuity of care. All discharging providers and nursing staff must complete the applicable checklist items prior to patient discharge.

## 2. Discharge Planning Timeline

**Within 24 hours of admission:** Identify anticipated discharge needs including home health, durable medical equipment, rehabilitation services, and social work involvement. Begin addressing barriers to discharge (insurance authorization, transportation, caregiver availability).

**48 hours before anticipated discharge:** Confirm follow-up appointments are scheduled. Initiate medication reconciliation. Order pending discharge medications. Arrange post-discharge services.

**Day of discharge:** Complete all checklist items below. Conduct teach-back education with patient and/or caregiver. Provide written discharge instructions.

## 3. Medication Reconciliation

Medication reconciliation is required at every transition of care. The discharging provider must:

1. Review the pre-admission medication list (obtained at admission)
2. Compare with the current inpatient medication orders
3. Identify all changes made during hospitalization (new medications, dose changes, discontinued medications)
4. Document the rationale for each change in the discharge summary
5. Ensure the patient understands what changed and why

**High-risk medication categories requiring additional counseling:** anticoagulants, insulin, opioids, immunosuppressants, and medications with narrow therapeutic indices (digoxin, lithium, phenytoin).

**Duplicate therapy check:** Verify no therapeutic duplications exist on the discharge medication list (e.g., two ACE inhibitors, two statins, two PPIs).

## 4. Discharge Checklist

### 4.1 Clinical Requirements

- [ ] Discharge diagnosis documented
- [ ] Discharge condition documented (stable, improved, etc.)
- [ ] Activity restrictions documented
- [ ] Diet instructions documented

- [ ] New prescriptions transmitted to pharmacy
- [ ] Patient has confirmed ability to obtain medications (insurance coverage, pharmacy access)
- [ ] High-alert medications reviewed with patient and/or caregiver
- [ ] Anticoagulation plan documented (if applicable): drug, dose, duration, monitoring schedule
- [ ] Insulin regimen documented with clear sliding scale instructions (if applicable)

### 4.3 Patient Education (Teach-Back Method)

### 4.4 Care Coordination

- [ ] Discharge summary sent to PCP (within 24 hours of discharge)
- [ ] Home health referral placed (if applicable)
- [ ] DME ordered (if applicable)
- [ ] Social work needs addressed (transportation, housing, food insecurity)
- [ ] Pharmacy notified of new prescriptions requiring prior authorization

## 5. Readmission Risk Assessment

All patients should be assessed for readmission risk using the HOSPITAL score:

| Factor | Points |
|---|---|
| Hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL at discharge | 1 |
| Discharge from Oncology service | 2 |
| Sodium less than 135 mEq/L at discharge | 1 |
| Procedure during hospitalization | 1 |
| Index admission type: urgent/emergent | 1 |
| Number of admissions in prior year (0-1: 0, 2-5: 2, >5: 5) | 0-5 |
| Length of stay 5 or more days | 2 |

**Score interpretation:** 0 to 4: low risk. 5 to 6: intermediate risk. 7 or greater: high risk. Patients at intermediate or high risk require post-discharge phone call within 48 hours and PCP follow-up within 3 days.

## 6. Post-Discharge Follow-Up

**Phone call within 48 hours:** Nursing care transition team calls all intermediate and high-risk patients to: verify medication access, confirm follow-up appointments, assess symptom status, address questions.

**PCP follow-up:** All patients should see their PCP within 7 to 14 days of discharge. High-risk patients within 3 to 5 days. Ensure PCP has received the discharge summary before the visit.
