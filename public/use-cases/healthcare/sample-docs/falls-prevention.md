# Falls Prevention and Post-Fall Protocol

**Document ID:** CG-QS-2025-002
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Department:** Quality and Safety / Nursing
**Classification:** Clinical Guideline

## 1. Scope

This guideline applies to all adult inpatients. Falls are the most common adverse event in hospitalized patients, occurring in approximately 3 to 5 per 1,000 patient-days. Approximately 25% to 30% of falls result in injury, and 2% to 6% result in serious injury including fractures and intracranial hemorrhage.

## 2. Fall Risk Assessment

### 2.1 Morse Fall Scale

All patients must be assessed using the Morse Fall Scale on admission, every shift, after a fall, and with any change in condition.

| Factor | Criteria | Score |
|---|---|---|
| History of falling (within 3 months) | Yes | 25 |
| Secondary diagnosis | Yes | 15 |
| Ambulatory aid | Furniture/wall | 15 |
| | Crutch/cane/walker | 30 |
| IV/heparin lock | Yes | 20 |
| Gait | Impaired | 10 |
| | Weak | 20 |
| Mental status | Forgets limitations | 15 |

**Score interpretation:** 0 to 24: low risk (standard precautions). 25 to 44: moderate risk (implement fall prevention bundle). 45 or greater: high risk (implement fall prevention bundle plus additional interventions).

### 2.2 Additional Risk Factors

Beyond the Morse Scale, assess for: medications increasing fall risk (sedatives, opioids, antihypertensives, diuretics, anticholinergics), orthostatic hypotension, visual impairment, cognitive impairment or delirium, urinary urgency or frequency, lower extremity weakness, history of falls in the past 12 months, and age 65 or older.

## 3. Prevention Interventions

### 3.1 Standard Precautions (All Patients)

- Bed in lowest position with brakes locked
- Call light within reach at all times
- Non-skid footwear provided
- Clear pathway to bathroom (remove clutter, ensure adequate lighting)
- Patient education on fall prevention and use of call light
- Hourly rounding to assess needs (pain, positioning, toileting, personal items within reach)

### 3.2 Fall Prevention Bundle (Moderate and High Risk)

All standard precautions plus:
- Yellow fall risk wristband applied
- Yellow "Fall Risk" sign posted at bedside and on door
- Bed alarm activated when patient is in bed unattended
- Chair alarm activated when patient is in chair unattended
- Toileting schedule (offer assistance every 2 hours)
- Medication review: assess and minimize fall-risk-increasing medications
- Physical therapy consult for gait and balance assessment
- Occupational therapy consult for ADL safety assessment
- Non-pharmacologic sleep interventions to reduce sedative use

### 3.3 Additional High-Risk Interventions

- 1:1 sitter or continuous video monitoring for patients with delirium or severe cognitive impairment who attempt to ambulate independently
- Hip protectors for patients with osteoporosis and high fall risk
- Low bed or floor mat for patients who climb over side rails

## 4. Post-Fall Protocol

### 4.1 Immediate Response

1. Assess for injury: level of consciousness, pain, visible injury, range of motion
2. Check vital signs including orthostatic blood pressures
3. Do not move the patient until cervical spine injury has been ruled out (if mechanism suggests risk)
4. Assess for head injury: if the patient is on anticoagulants or has a head strike, obtain CT head without contrast within 6 hours

### 4.2 Notification Requirements

- Notify the attending physician or covering provider immediately
- Notify the charge nurse
- Notify the patient's family or designated contact within 2 hours
- File an incident report in the safety reporting system within 24 hours

### 4.3 Post-Fall Assessment

Within 2 hours of the fall, the responsible provider must:
- Document a post-fall assessment including mechanism, injuries, neurological exam
- Review and adjust medications contributing to fall risk
- Reassess fall risk score and update prevention plan
- Order imaging as clinically indicated

### 4.4 Post-Fall Monitoring

For patients with head injury or on anticoagulation:
- Neurological checks every 1 hour for 4 hours, then every 2 hours for 8 hours, then every 4 hours for 12 hours
- Report any change in neurological status immediately
- Lower threshold for repeat imaging if symptoms develop

## 5. Quality Metrics

The Falls Prevention Committee tracks the following metrics monthly:
- Falls per 1,000 patient-days (target: less than 3.0)
- Falls with injury per 1,000 patient-days (target: less than 1.0)
- Fall risk assessment compliance (target: greater than 95%)
- Post-fall protocol completion rate (target: 100%)

Unit-level data is reviewed at monthly quality meetings. Units with rates above threshold for two consecutive months require a root cause analysis and corrective action plan.
