# Type 2 Diabetes Management Guidelines

**Document ID:** CG-ENDO-2025-001
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Review Date:** January 1, 2026
**Department:** Endocrinology / Internal Medicine
**Classification:** Clinical Guideline

## 1. Scope

This guideline applies to the management of adult patients (age 18 and older) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. It covers glycemic targets, pharmacologic therapy, monitoring protocols, and referral criteria. Pediatric patients, Type 1 diabetes, and gestational diabetes are covered under separate guidelines.

## 2. Glycemic Targets

### 2.1 HbA1c Targets

**Standard target:** HbA1c less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) for most non-pregnant adults. This target has been shown to reduce microvascular complications.

**Less stringent target:** HbA1c less than 8.0% (64 mmol/mol) for patients with: limited life expectancy, history of severe hypoglycemia, extensive comorbidities, long-standing diabetes with difficulty achieving target despite adequate therapy, or advanced complications.

**More stringent target:** HbA1c less than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) may be appropriate for: newly diagnosed patients, patients with a long expected lifespan, patients without significant cardiovascular disease, and patients able to achieve this without significant hypoglycemia.

### 2.2 Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG)

For patients on insulin therapy, SMBG is recommended before meals and at bedtime. Fasting glucose target: 80 to 130 mg/dL. Postprandial glucose target (1 to 2 hours after meal onset): less than 180 mg/dL.

For patients not on insulin, routine SMBG may not be necessary if HbA1c is at target. Consider SMBG during acute illness or when adjusting medications.

### 2.3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)

Consider CGM for patients on multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy. Time in range (TIR) target: greater than 70% of readings between 70 and 180 mg/dL. Time below range: less than 4% of readings below 70 mg/dL, less than 1% below 54 mg/dL.

## 3. Pharmacologic Therapy

### 3.1 First-Line Therapy

**Metformin** remains the recommended first-line pharmacologic agent for most patients with Type 2 diabetes. Starting dose: 500 mg once daily with the largest meal. Titrate by 500 mg weekly to a target dose of 1,000 mg twice daily, as tolerated.

Contraindications to metformin: eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m2, active or chronic metabolic acidosis, hepatic impairment (ALT greater than 3 times upper limit of normal).

For patients with eGFR 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73m2: do not initiate metformin, but may continue at reduced dose (maximum 1,000 mg daily) if already established on therapy.

### 3.2 Second-Line Agents (Medication Ladder)

When metformin alone is insufficient (HbA1c above target after 3 months at maximum tolerated dose) or when metformin is contraindicated, select a second-line agent based on patient characteristics:

**SGLT2 Inhibitors** (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin): Preferred add-on for patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Provide cardiovascular and renal benefits independent of glucose lowering.

**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists** (semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide): Preferred add-on for patients with ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk. Also preferred when weight reduction is a priority. Associated with 15% to 20% weight loss with semaglutide.

**DPP-4 Inhibitors** (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin): Consider when SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are not appropriate. Modest HbA1c reduction (0.5% to 0.8%). Well tolerated with low hypoglycemia risk.

**Thiazolidinediones** (pioglitazone): Consider for patients with significant insulin resistance. Avoid in heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV). Monitor for weight gain, fluid retention, and bone density changes.

**Insulin Therapy:** See separate Insulin Protocols guideline (CG-ENDO-2025-007) for detailed insulin initiation and titration.

### 3.3 Combination Therapy

Combination therapy with two or three agents from different classes is often necessary to achieve glycemic targets. When initiating combination therapy, consider complementary mechanisms of action, patient comorbidities, side effect profiles, cost, and patient preference.

## 4. Monitoring Schedule

### 4.1 Routine Monitoring

- HbA1c: every 3 months until stable at target, then every 6 months
- Fasting lipid panel: annually
- Serum creatinine and eGFR: annually (more frequently if eGFR declining)
- Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR): annually
- Comprehensive foot examination: annually
- Dilated eye examination: annually (may extend to every 2 years if no retinopathy)
- Blood pressure: every visit

### 4.2 Medication-Specific Monitoring

**Metformin:** Serum creatinine and eGFR at baseline, then at least annually. Vitamin B12 level every 2 to 3 years for patients on long-term therapy.

**SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Renal function at baseline, within 3 months, then annually. Monitor for urinary tract infections and genital mycotic infections.

**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:** No routine labs required. Monitor for GI side effects during titration.

## 5. Referral Criteria

Refer to Endocrinology for: HbA1c persistently above 9% despite combination therapy, frequent or severe hypoglycemia, consideration of insulin pump therapy or CGM, pregnancy planning in women with diabetes.

Refer to Nephrology per CKD staging guidelines when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m2 or with rapid eGFR decline.

Refer to Ophthalmology for annual dilated exam and urgently for any vision changes.
