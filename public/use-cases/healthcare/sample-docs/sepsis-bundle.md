# Sepsis Recognition and Management Bundle

**Document ID:** CG-CC-2025-001
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Review Date:** January 1, 2026
**Department:** Emergency Medicine, Intensive Care, Hospital Medicine
**Approved By:** Sepsis Quality Improvement Committee

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This bundle provides a standardized approach to the early recognition, diagnosis, and management of sepsis and septic shock in adult patients. It applies to all clinical settings within the hospital, including the emergency department, inpatient wards, and intensive care units.

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1 Sepsis (Sepsis-3)

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Organ dysfunction is identified by an acute change in the total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or greater.

### 2.2 SOFA Score Components

| Organ System | Measurement | Scoring (0 to 4) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Respiration | PaO2/FiO2 ratio | 400+ (0) to less than 100 (4) |
| Coagulation | Platelets (x10^3/uL) | 150+ (0) to less than 20 (4) |
| Liver | Bilirubin (mg/dL) | less than 1.2 (0) to 12+ (4) |
| Cardiovascular | MAP and vasopressor use | MAP 70+ (0) to high-dose pressors (4) |
| CNS | Glasgow Coma Scale | 15 (0) to less than 6 (4) |
| Renal | Creatinine (mg/dL) or urine output | less than 1.2 (0) to 5+ or less than 200 mL/day (4) |

### 2.3 Septic Shock

Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality. Identified by the need for vasopressors to maintain MAP of 65 mmHg or greater AND serum lactate greater than 2 mmol/L despite adequate volume resuscitation.

## 3. Screening: Quick SOFA (qSOFA)

Use qSOFA as a bedside screening tool for patients with suspected infection outside the ICU. A score of 2 or more warrants further evaluation for organ dysfunction:

- Respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute or greater (1 point)
- Altered mentation, GCS less than 15 (1 point)
- Systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or less (1 point)

Note: qSOFA is a screening prompt, not a diagnostic criterion. A positive screen should trigger full SOFA assessment and clinical evaluation.

## 4. Hour-1 Bundle

The following interventions should be initiated within 1 hour of sepsis recognition. Time zero is the moment of triage or the earliest documentation of suspected sepsis.

### 4.1 Measure Serum Lactate

- Obtain an initial serum lactate level
- If lactate is greater than 2 mmol/L, remeasure within 2 to 4 hours to assess for clearance
- Target: lactate normalization or a decrease of 20% or greater within 6 hours

### 4.2 Obtain Blood Cultures Before Antibiotics

- Draw at least 2 sets of blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) from 2 separate sites before the first dose of antibiotics
- If obtaining cultures would delay antibiotics beyond 45 minutes, administer antibiotics and draw cultures as soon as possible thereafter
- Obtain additional cultures from indwelling lines, urine, sputum, or wounds as clinically indicated

### 4.3 Administer Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics

- Empiric therapy should be initiated within 1 hour of sepsis recognition
- Select agents based on suspected source, local antibiogram, and patient risk factors for resistant organisms

| Suspected Source | Recommended Empiric Regimen |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Unknown / pulmonary | Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h |
| Urinary | Ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily, add vancomycin if catheter-associated |
| Intra-abdominal | Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h |
| Skin/soft tissue | Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading + piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h |
| MRSA risk factors | Add vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose to any regimen |

### 4.4 Administer IV Crystalloid for Hypotension or Elevated Lactate

- Give 30 mL/kg of balanced crystalloid (lactated Ringer's preferred) for:
  - Hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg or MAP less than 65 mmHg), OR
  - Serum lactate of 4 mmol/L or greater
- Administer over the first 1 to 3 hours
- Reassess volume status and tissue perfusion after each bolus using clinical indicators: capillary refill, skin mottling, urine output, and dynamic measures if available (pulse pressure variation, passive leg raise)

### 4.5 Initiate Vasopressors if MAP Remains Below 65 mmHg

- Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor, starting at 0.05 mcg/kg/min and titrating to MAP of 65 mmHg or greater
- If norepinephrine dose exceeds 0.25 mcg/kg/min, add vasopressin 0.04 units/min as a fixed-dose adjunct
- Consider epinephrine as a second-line agent if additional support is needed
- Central venous access is preferred; however, short-term peripheral administration of dilute norepinephrine is acceptable while central access is obtained

## 5. Reassessment at 6 Hours

Within 6 hours of sepsis identification, the following must be documented:

- Reassessment of volume status and tissue perfusion
- Repeat lactate if the initial value was elevated
- Response to antibiotics and source control (assess need for surgical or procedural intervention)
- Hemodynamic status and vasopressor requirements

## 6. Antibiotic De-Escalation

- Review culture and sensitivity data daily
- Narrow antibiotic coverage within 48 to 72 hours when culture results and clinical improvement permit
- Procalcitonin trending may assist in guiding the duration of therapy
- Target total antibiotic course of 7 to 10 days for most infections; shorter courses may be appropriate based on source control and clinical response

## 7. Documentation and Quality Metrics

- SEP-1 (CMS Sepsis Core Measure) compliance should be documented in the electronic health record
- All elements of the Hour-1 Bundle must have time-stamped entries
- Sepsis coordinator to audit compliance weekly
