# Chronic Kidney Disease Staging and Management

**Document ID:** CG-NEPH-2025-001
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Department:** Nephrology / Internal Medicine
**Classification:** Clinical Guideline

## 1. Definition

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for more than 3 months, with implications for health. The diagnosis requires either: reduced GFR (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2) or markers of kidney damage (albuminuria, urine sediment abnormalities, electrolyte abnormalities, structural abnormalities, or history of kidney transplantation).

## 2. eGFR Calculation

Estimated GFR should be calculated using the CKD-EPI 2021 creatinine equation (race-free). Report eGFR with all serum creatinine measurements.

**CKD-EPI 2021 Equation:** eGFR = 142 x min(Scr/kappa, 1)^alpha x max(Scr/kappa, 1)^-1.200 x 0.9938^Age x 1.012 [if female]

Where kappa = 0.7 (female) or 0.9 (male), alpha = -0.241 (female) or -0.302 (male).

Cystatin C-based eGFR may be used for confirmation when creatinine-based eGFR may be inaccurate (extremes of body mass, muscle wasting, high protein diet, or creatine supplements).

## 3. CKD Staging

### 3.1 GFR Categories

| Stage | eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | 90 or greater | Normal or high |
| G2 | 60 to 89 | Mildly decreased |
| G3a | 45 to 59 | Mildly to moderately decreased |
| G3b | 30 to 44 | Moderately to severely decreased |
| G4 | 15 to 29 | Severely decreased |
| G5 | Less than 15 | Kidney failure |

### 3.2 Albuminuria Categories

| Category | ACR (mg/g) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Less than 30 | Normal to mildly increased |
| A2 | 30 to 300 | Moderately increased |
| A3 | Greater than 300 | Severely increased |

The combination of GFR category and albuminuria category determines overall risk and management intensity.

## 4. Medication Adjustment by CKD Stage

Multiple medications require dose adjustment or discontinuation as renal function declines.

**Stage 3a (eGFR 45 to 59):** Review all medications for renal dosing. Metformin: continue at full dose. NSAIDs: avoid chronic use. Begin monitoring phosphorus and PTH annually.

**Stage 3b (eGFR 30 to 44):** Metformin: reduce to maximum 1,000 mg daily if already on therapy; do not initiate. NSAIDs: avoid. Gabapentin and pregabalin: dose adjustment required. Monitor calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and vitamin D every 6 months.

**Stage 4 (eGFR 15 to 29):** Metformin: contraindicated, discontinue. Most sulfonylureas: discontinue (except glipizide). Reduce insulin doses by 25% to 50%. Refer to nephrology for renal replacement therapy planning. Begin dialysis access planning when eGFR approaches 15 to 20.

**Stage 5 (eGFR less than 15):** Initiate renal replacement therapy based on symptoms, not solely on eGFR threshold. Options: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation, or conservative management.

## 5. Monitoring Schedule

| Parameter | G1-G2, A1 | G3a | G3b | G4 | G5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| eGFR | Annually | Every 6 months | Every 3 months | Every 3 months | Monthly |
| ACR | Annually | Every 6 months | Every 3 months | Every 3 months | Monthly |
| Electrolytes | Annually | Every 6 months | Every 3 months | Every 3 months | Monthly |
| Ca/Phos/PTH | N/A | Annually | Every 6 months | Every 3 months | Monthly |
| Hemoglobin | Annually | Annually | Every 6 months | Every 3 months | Monthly |
| Vitamin D | N/A | Annually | Every 6 months | Every 6 months | Every 3 months |

## 6. Nephrology Referral Criteria

Refer to nephrology when:
- eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m2 (Stage 4)
- Rapid decline in eGFR: greater than 5 mL/min/1.73m2 per year, or greater than 25% decline over 12 months
- Persistent albuminuria: ACR greater than 300 mg/g despite optimized RAAS inhibition
- Etiology of CKD is unclear
- Refractory hypertension (4 or more agents)
- Persistent electrolyte abnormalities (hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis)
- Recurrent nephrolithiasis
- Suspected glomerulonephritis (active urine sediment, low complement)
- Hereditary kidney disease (ADPKD, Alport syndrome)

**Urgent referral:** accelerated eGFR decline (greater than 15 mL/min in 3 months), nephrotic-range proteinuria (ACR greater than 2,200 mg/g), suspected rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
