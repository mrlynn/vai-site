# Pain Management Protocol

**Document ID:** CG-PAIN-2025-001
**Effective Date:** March 1, 2025
**Review Date:** March 1, 2026
**Department:** Anesthesiology, Pharmacy, Hospital Medicine
**Approved By:** Pain Management and Opioid Stewardship Committee

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This protocol establishes a standardized, multimodal approach to pain assessment and management for adult patients in both acute and chronic settings. It emphasizes non-opioid first-line therapies, evidence-based prescribing, and opioid stewardship principles.

## 2. Pain Assessment

### 2.1 Assessment Tools

- **Numeric Rating Scale (NRS):** 0 to 10 scale; 0 indicates no pain, 10 indicates worst possible pain. Preferred for patients who can self-report.
- **Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale:** Visual faces scale for patients with language barriers, cognitive impairment, or difficulty with numeric scales.
- **FLACC Scale (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability):** For patients who are non-verbal or unable to self-report.
- **CPOT (Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool):** For intubated or sedated patients in the ICU.

### 2.2 Assessment Frequency

- On admission and at each nursing encounter
- Within 30 minutes of IV analgesic administration
- Within 60 minutes of oral analgesic administration
- With each new report of pain
- Reassess functional status in addition to pain intensity: ability to ambulate, participate in physical therapy, sleep, and perform deep breathing exercises

## 3. Multimodal Analgesic Framework

A multimodal approach combining pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies is the foundation of this protocol. The goal is to optimize pain relief while minimizing reliance on opioid monotherapy.

### 3.1 Adapted WHO Analgesic Ladder

**Step 1: Mild Pain (NRS 1-3)**
- Acetaminophen 650-1000 mg PO/IV every 6 hours (maximum 3 g/day; 2 g/day in hepatic impairment or age 65 or older)
- NSAIDs: Ibuprofen 400-600 mg PO every 6-8 hours or ketorolac 15-30 mg IV every 6 hours (maximum 5 days for ketorolac)
- Topical agents: Lidocaine 5% patch, diclofenac gel, capsaicin cream

**Step 2: Moderate Pain (NRS 4-6)**
- Continue Step 1 agents as scheduled (not PRN)
- Add tramadol 50-100 mg PO every 6 hours (maximum 400 mg/day), or low-dose opioid if warranted
- Regional anesthesia techniques when appropriate (peripheral nerve blocks, local infiltration)

**Step 3: Severe Pain (NRS 7-10)**
- Continue Step 1 agents
- Opioid therapy with the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration
- IV opioids for acute severe pain: morphine 2-4 mg IV every 3-4 hours, hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV every 3-4 hours, or fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV every 1-2 hours
- Consider patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for sustained parenteral requirements

## 4. Regional Anesthesia and Interventional Techniques

- Peripheral nerve blocks (femoral, interscalene, popliteal, TAP block) are preferred for surgical and traumatic pain
- Epidural analgesia may be considered for thoracic, abdominal, or lower extremity surgery
- Consult the Acute Pain Service for catheter-based techniques or PCA management
- Benefits include reduced opioid consumption, improved mobilization, and decreased pulmonary complications

## 5. Chronic Pain Management

### 5.1 Tiered Pharmacologic Approach

**Tier 1: Non-Opioid Analgesics**
- Scheduled acetaminophen, oral NSAIDs (with GI and renal risk assessment)
- Topical analgesics

**Tier 2: Adjuvant Agents**
- Neuropathic pain: Gabapentin starting at 100-300 mg TID, titrate to 1200-3600 mg/day in divided doses; pregabalin 75 mg BID, titrate to 150-300 mg BID
- Duloxetine 30 mg daily for 1 week, then 60 mg daily (effective for neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, chronic musculoskeletal pain)
- Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) at low doses for neuropathic and central pain syndromes
- Muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine) for musculoskeletal spasm, short-term use preferred

**Tier 3: Opioid Therapy (Chronic)**
- Reserve for patients who have failed non-opioid approaches
- Initiate only after completing a comprehensive risk assessment (see Section 6)
- Start with immediate-release formulations at the lowest effective dose
- Transition to extended-release only after establishing a stable daily requirement

### 5.2 Non-Pharmacologic Interventions

- Physical therapy: strengthening, flexibility, and functional restoration programs
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): evidence-based for chronic pain, especially with comorbid anxiety or depression
- Acupuncture: may be considered for chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, and headache disorders
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
- Occupational therapy for functional adaptation

## 6. Opioid Stewardship

### 6.1 Prescribing Limits

- Acute pain (opioid-naive): Maximum 3-day supply for most indications; 7-day supply for post-surgical pain
- Prescriptions exceeding 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day require documented justification and a pain management consultation
- Avoid concurrent prescribing of opioids with benzodiazepines whenever possible; if co-prescribed, document the clinical rationale

### 6.2 Risk Assessment

Before initiating opioid therapy, the following steps are required:

1. Query the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) database
2. Assess risk using the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) or SOAPP-R
3. Review the patient's history for substance use disorder, prior opioid prescriptions, and overdose events
4. Obtain a baseline urine drug screen
5. Document a treatment agreement for chronic opioid therapy

### 6.3 Naloxone Co-Prescribing

Naloxone (Narcan) should be co-prescribed for patients receiving opioid prescriptions who have any of the following risk factors:

- Opioid dose of 50 MME per day or greater
- Concurrent benzodiazepine use
- History of substance use disorder or prior overdose
- Respiratory conditions (COPD, obstructive sleep apnea)
- Patient or caregiver request

Prescribe naloxone 4 mg intranasal, with instructions on use provided to the patient and household contacts.

### 6.4 Tapering Protocol

When discontinuation or dose reduction of chronic opioids is indicated:

- Taper by 10% of the total daily dose every 1 to 2 weeks for gradual taper
- Rapid taper (10-25% reduction every few days) may be considered in specific clinical scenarios with close monitoring
- Monitor for withdrawal symptoms: anxiety, insomnia, diaphoresis, myalgias, GI distress
- Provide supportive medications as needed: clonidine 0.1 mg BID, loperamide, hydroxyzine
- Refer to addiction medicine if opioid use disorder is identified during tapering

## 7. Documentation Requirements

- Pain assessment scores recorded at each nursing encounter
- Functional outcomes documented alongside pain scores
- PDMP query documented before each new opioid prescription
- Treatment agreements scanned into the medical record for chronic opioid therapy
