**Document ID:** DR-CARD-2025-002
**Effective Date:** February 15, 2025
**Review Date:** February 15, 2026
**Department:** Cardiology, Pharmacy
**Approved By:** Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This reference document summarizes high-risk drug interactions commonly encountered in patients receiving cardiac medications. It is intended for use by physicians, pharmacists, and advanced practice providers to support safe prescribing, dispensing, and medication reconciliation.

## 2. Interaction Severity Classification

| Severity Level | Definition | Action Required |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Contraindicated | Combination should never be used | Do not co-prescribe; select alternative agent |
| Major | Combination may result in serious harm | Avoid if possible; if necessary, implement intensive monitoring |
| Moderate | Combination may worsen patient condition | Monitor closely; adjust doses as indicated |
| Minor | Combination has limited clinical significance | Be aware; routine monitoring sufficient |

## 3. High-Risk Interactions

### 3.1 Amiodarone and Warfarin

- **Mechanism:** Amiodarone inhibits CYP2C9, the primary enzyme responsible for warfarin metabolism
- **Clinical Effect:** Warfarin levels increase significantly, raising INR and bleeding risk
- **Management:** Reduce warfarin dose by 30% to 50% when initiating amiodarone. Check INR within 3 to 5 days and weekly for the first 4 to 6 weeks. Note that this interaction may persist for weeks after amiodarone discontinuation due to its prolonged half-life (40 to 55 days).
- **Severity:** Major

### 3.2 Amiodarone and Digoxin

- **Mechanism:** Amiodarone inhibits P-glycoprotein, reducing renal clearance of digoxin
- **Clinical Effect:** Serum digoxin levels may increase by 70% to 100%, risking toxicity (nausea, visual changes, arrhythmias)
- **Management:** Reduce digoxin dose by 50% when starting amiodarone. Monitor serum digoxin levels within 1 week and periodically thereafter. Target digoxin level: 0.5 to 0.9 ng/mL for heart failure.
- **Severity:** Major

### 3.3 Statins and CYP3A4 Inhibitors

- **Affected Statins:** Simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin (metabolized by CYP3A4)
- **Common Inhibitors:** Amiodarone, diltiazem, verapamil, grapefruit juice, azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin), HIV protease inhibitors
- **Clinical Effect:** Elevated statin levels increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis
- **Management:**
  - Simvastatin: Do not exceed 20 mg/day with amiodarone or diltiazem; avoid with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
  - Lovastatin: Similar restrictions apply
  - Atorvastatin: Use the lowest effective dose with moderate inhibitors; avoid with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or switch to rosuvastatin or pravastatin (not CYP3A4-dependent)
- **Severity:** Major (with strong inhibitors), Moderate (with moderate inhibitors)

### 3.4 ACE Inhibitors/ARBs and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- **Agents Involved:** Lisinopril, enalapril, losartan, valsartan combined with spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, or triamterene
- **Clinical Effect:** Additive hyperkalemia risk, potentially causing life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias
- **Management:** Monitor serum potassium within 1 week of initiating the combination, at 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter. Avoid the combination if baseline potassium is greater than 5.0 mEq/L or eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Educate patients on potassium-rich food intake.
- **Severity:** Major

### 3.5 Beta-Blockers and Non-Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers

- **Agents Involved:** Metoprolol, atenolol, carvedilol combined with diltiazem or verapamil
- **Clinical Effect:** Additive negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects, leading to symptomatic bradycardia, heart block, or hemodynamic compromise
- **Management:** Avoid the combination when possible. If clinically necessary, monitor heart rate and ECG closely. Ensure a baseline ECG shows no AV conduction abnormalities before initiating. Use with extreme caution in patients with pre-existing conduction disease.
- **Severity:** Major

### 3.6 NSAIDs and Anticoagulants

- **Agents Involved:** Ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac combined with warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or other anticoagulants
- **Clinical Effect:** NSAIDs impair platelet function and can cause GI mucosal injury, substantially increasing the risk of GI bleeding when combined with anticoagulants. NSAIDs also reduce renal prostaglandins, potentially affecting anticoagulant clearance.
- **Management:** Avoid NSAIDs in anticoagulated patients whenever possible. If short-term NSAID use is unavoidable, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and co-prescribe a proton pump inhibitor for GI protection. Monitor for signs of bleeding.
- **Severity:** Major

### 3.7 NSAIDs and Heart Failure Medications

- **Clinical Effect:** NSAIDs cause sodium and water retention, increase blood pressure, and may reduce the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, and beta-blockers. NSAID use is associated with increased heart failure hospitalization.
- **Management:** Avoid NSAIDs in patients with heart failure. Use acetaminophen or topical analgesics as alternatives. If an NSAID is absolutely required, use celecoxib at the lowest dose for the shortest duration and monitor weight, blood pressure, renal function, and fluid status closely.
- **Severity:** Major

## 4. QTc Prolongation Risk

### 4.1 Common QTc-Prolonging Agents in Hospital Settings

The following medications are frequently prescribed and carry risk for QTc prolongation. The risk is amplified when multiple QTc-prolonging agents are used concurrently or in the setting of electrolyte abnormalities.

| Drug Class | Agents | Relative Risk |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Antiarrhythmics | Amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, procainamide | High |
| Antibiotics | Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), azithromycin, erythromycin | Moderate to High |
| Antiemetics | Ondansetron (IV doses greater than 16 mg), droperidol | Moderate |
| Antipsychotics | Haloperidol (especially IV), quetiapine, ziprasidone | Moderate to High |
| Opioids | Methadone | High |
| Antifungals | Fluconazole | Moderate |

### 4.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Obtain a baseline ECG and calculate QTc before initiating known QTc-prolonging agents
- Correct electrolyte abnormalities before administration: target potassium greater than 4.0 mEq/L, magnesium greater than 2.0 mg/dL
- Monitor with repeat ECG within 24 to 48 hours of initiation or dose change
- Hold or discontinue the offending agent if QTc exceeds 500 ms or increases by more than 60 ms from baseline
- Avoid combining two or more agents from the table above whenever a therapeutic alternative exists
- Pharmacy will generate automated alerts for orders involving two or more QTc-prolonging agents

## 5. Monitoring Summary

| Interaction | Key Monitoring Parameters | Frequency |
|------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Amiodarone + Warfarin | INR | Weekly for 4-6 weeks, then per protocol |
| Amiodarone + Digoxin | Serum digoxin level | Within 1 week, then every 2-4 weeks |
| ACEi/ARB + K-sparing diuretic | Serum potassium, creatinine | 1 week, 1 month, then every 3 months |
| Beta-blocker + Diltiazem/Verapamil | Heart rate, ECG | Baseline, 48 hours, then weekly |
| QTc-prolonging combinations | ECG (QTc interval), K+, Mg2+ | Baseline, 24-48 hours, then as indicated |
| NSAID + Anticoagulant | CBC, signs of bleeding | Weekly if concurrent use is necessary |

## 6. Pharmacist Responsibilities

- Screen all new medication orders against the patient's active medication list for high-risk interactions
- Document interventions and recommendations in the pharmacist progress note
- Notify the prescribing provider of major or contraindicated interactions within 1 hour of identification
- Provide drug interaction counseling to patients at discharge
