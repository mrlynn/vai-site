# Glycemic Management in Chronic Kidney Disease

**Document ID:** CG-ENDO-2025-002
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Department:** Endocrinology / Nephrology
**Classification:** Clinical Guideline

## 1. Overview

Approximately 40% of patients with Type 2 diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). Glycemic management in these patients is complicated by altered drug metabolism, increased hypoglycemia risk, and the interplay between renal protection and glucose control. This guideline addresses medication selection and dosing across CKD stages.

## 2. General Principles

As kidney function declines, several changes affect diabetes management: insulin clearance decreases (increasing hypoglycemia risk), many oral agents require dose adjustment or discontinuation, HbA1c may be less reliable in advanced CKD due to altered red blood cell turnover, and the risk-benefit balance of tight glycemic control shifts.

**HbA1c Targets in CKD:**
- CKD Stages 1 to 3: Standard target of less than 7.0% for most patients
- CKD Stages 4 to 5 (including dialysis): Consider a less stringent target of less than 7.5% to 8.0%, individualized based on life expectancy, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk

## 3. Medication Management by CKD Stage

### 3.1 CKD Stage 3a (eGFR 45 to 59)

**Metformin:** Continue at full dose. Monitor renal function every 3 to 6 months.

**SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Continue for cardiorenal benefit. Glucose-lowering efficacy diminishes but cardiovascular and renal protective effects persist. Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin are approved for use down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73m2 for cardiorenal indications.

**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:** No dose adjustment required. Continue for cardiovascular benefit.

**DPP-4 Inhibitors:** Sitagliptin: reduce to 50 mg daily. Linagliptin: no adjustment needed.

**Sulfonylureas:** Use with caution. Prefer glipizide (hepatically cleared) over glyburide. Reduce dose and monitor for hypoglycemia.

### 3.2 CKD Stage 3b (eGFR 30 to 44)

**Metformin:** Do not initiate. If already on therapy, reduce to maximum 1,000 mg daily. Monitor renal function every 3 months. Discontinue if eGFR falls below 30.

**SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Continue for cardiorenal protection. Initiation for glucose lowering alone is not recommended at this eGFR, but initiation for CKD or heart failure indications is appropriate.

**Insulin:** May need dose reduction as renal clearance of insulin decreases.

### 3.3 CKD Stage 4 (eGFR 15 to 29)

**Metformin:** Contraindicated. Discontinue.

**SGLT2 Inhibitors:** May continue for cardiorenal benefit (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin approved down to eGFR 20). Discontinue when dialysis is initiated.

**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:** Use with caution. Limited data in severe CKD. Semaglutide does not require dose adjustment but monitor for GI side effects which may worsen with uremia.

**Insulin:** Often required. Reduce doses by 25% to 50% compared to earlier CKD stages. Use basal-bolus regimen with careful titration. Monitor closely for hypoglycemia.

### 3.4 CKD Stage 5 / Dialysis (eGFR below 15)

**Preferred agents:** Insulin (with significant dose reduction), linagliptin (only DPP-4 inhibitor not requiring renal adjustment).

**Avoid:** Metformin, most sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors on dialysis.

**Monitoring:** Fructosamine or glycated albumin may be more reliable than HbA1c in patients on dialysis due to altered erythrocyte survival.

## 4. Renal Protective Strategies

All patients with diabetic kidney disease should receive:
- ACE inhibitor or ARB at maximum tolerated dose (see ACE Inhibitor Reference)
- Blood pressure target less than 130/80 mmHg
- SGLT2 inhibitor if eGFR permits (for cardiorenal protection)
- Statin therapy per cardiovascular risk guidelines
- Dietary counseling: sodium restriction to less than 2,000 mg daily, protein intake 0.8 g/kg/day in CKD 3 to 5

## 5. Specialist Referral

Patients with diabetic nephropathy showing rapid eGFR decline (greater than 5 mL/min/1.73m2 per year) should be co-managed with Nephrology. Consider referral when ACR exceeds 300 mg/g or eGFR drops below 45 mL/min/1.73m2.
