# Hypertension Management Guidelines

**Document ID:** CG-CARD-2025-001
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Department:** Cardiology / Internal Medicine
**Classification:** Clinical Guideline

## 1. Diagnosis

Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130 mmHg or greater, or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 80 mmHg or greater, based on an average of two or more properly measured readings on two or more occasions.

**Classification:**

| Category | Systolic (mmHg) | Diastolic (mmHg) |
|---|---|---|
| Normal | Less than 120 | Less than 80 |
| Elevated | 120 to 129 | Less than 80 |
| Stage 1 Hypertension | 130 to 139 | 80 to 89 |
| Stage 2 Hypertension | 140 or greater | 90 or greater |
| Hypertensive Crisis | Greater than 180 | Greater than 120 |

Confirm diagnosis with out-of-office measurements (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring) before initiating pharmacotherapy.

## 2. Blood Pressure Targets

**General target:** Less than 130/80 mmHg for most adults with hypertension.

**Specific populations:**
- Diabetes mellitus: less than 130/80 mmHg
- CKD: less than 130/80 mmHg (less than 120/80 if proteinuria with ACR greater than 300 mg/g)
- Age 65 and older: target SBP less than 130 mmHg if tolerated; less than 140 mmHg if at risk for falls or orthostatic hypotension
- Post-stroke: less than 130/80 mmHg after the acute phase
- Heart failure: optimize per heart failure guidelines, typically less than 130/80 mmHg

## 3. Non-Pharmacologic Therapy

Recommend lifestyle modifications for all patients with elevated blood pressure or hypertension:
- DASH diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy): estimated SBP reduction 8 to 14 mmHg
- Sodium restriction to less than 2,300 mg daily (ideally less than 1,500 mg): SBP reduction 5 to 6 mmHg
- Physical activity: at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise: SBP reduction 4 to 9 mmHg
- Weight loss: target BMI less than 25 kg/m2: SBP reduction approximately 1 mmHg per kg lost
- Alcohol moderation: no more than 2 drinks per day for men, 1 for women: SBP reduction 2 to 4 mmHg
- Smoking cessation: for overall cardiovascular risk reduction

## 4. First-Line Pharmacologic Agents

### 4.1 ACE Inhibitors / ARBs

Preferred for patients with: diabetes, CKD with proteinuria, heart failure, post-MI. See separate ACE Inhibitor Reference for detailed prescribing.

Do not combine ACE inhibitors with ARBs (increased risk of hyperkalemia, renal impairment, hypotension without benefit).

### 4.2 Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)

Dihydropyridine CCBs (amlodipine, nifedipine) are first-line options. Particularly effective in: elderly patients, Black patients, and isolated systolic hypertension. Amlodipine starting dose: 5 mg daily, maximum 10 mg daily. Common side effects: peripheral edema, headache, flushing.

### 4.3 Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics

Chlorthalidone 12.5 to 25 mg daily (preferred over HCTZ due to longer half-life and stronger outcomes data). Indapamide 1.25 to 2.5 mg daily as alternative. Monitor electrolytes (potassium, sodium, magnesium) and uric acid. Caution in patients with gout.

## 5. Combination Therapy

Most patients will require two or more agents to achieve target. When SBP is 20 mmHg or more above goal, or DBP is 10 mmHg or more above goal, consider initiating two agents simultaneously.

**Preferred combinations:**
- ACE inhibitor/ARB + CCB
- ACE inhibitor/ARB + thiazide diuretic
- CCB + thiazide diuretic

**Avoid:** ACE inhibitor + ARB (dual RAAS blockade).

## 6. Resistant Hypertension

Defined as blood pressure above target despite three antihypertensive agents at optimal doses from different classes, including a diuretic, or blood pressure controlled on four or more agents.

**Evaluation:** Confirm medication adherence, exclude white coat effect with ambulatory monitoring, screen for secondary causes (renal artery stenosis, primary aldosteronism, obstructive sleep apnea, pheochromocytoma, thyroid disease), optimize lifestyle modifications.

**Fourth-line agent:** Spironolactone 25 to 50 mg daily is the recommended fourth-line agent for resistant hypertension. Monitor potassium closely, especially with concurrent ACE inhibitor/ARB use.

## 7. Hypertensive Crisis

**Hypertensive urgency** (SBP greater than 180 or DBP greater than 120, without acute target organ damage): reinstate or intensify oral therapy, reduce BP gradually over 24 to 48 hours, close outpatient follow-up.

**Hypertensive emergency** (SBP greater than 180 or DBP greater than 120 with acute target organ damage: stroke, ACS, aortic dissection, eclampsia, acute renal failure): requires ICU admission and IV antihypertensive therapy. Target: reduce mean arterial pressure by no more than 25% in the first hour, then to 160/100 mmHg over the next 2 to 6 hours.
