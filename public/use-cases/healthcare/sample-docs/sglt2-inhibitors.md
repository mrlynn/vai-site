# SGLT2 Inhibitor Class Overview

**Document ID:** DR-ENDO-2025-002
**Classification:** Drug Reference
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## 1. Class Overview

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors block glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney, promoting glycosuria and lowering blood glucose. Beyond glucose lowering, this class has demonstrated significant cardiovascular and renal protective benefits that are independent of their glycemic effects.

**Available agents:** empagliflozin (Jardiance), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), canagliflozin (Invokana), ertugliflozin (Steglatro).

## 2. Indications

- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (as add-on to metformin or as first-line when metformin is contraindicated)
- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin): regardless of diabetes status
- Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin)
- Chronic kidney disease (dapagliflozin): regardless of diabetes status, eGFR 20 to 75

## 3. Cardiovascular Benefits

Landmark trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) showed a 14% reduction in MACE and a 38% reduction in cardiovascular death. Canagliflozin (CANVAS) showed a 14% reduction in MACE.

All agents in the class reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 30% to 35%, a benefit that appears to be a class effect.

## 4. Renal Benefits

SGLT2 inhibitors provide renal protection through multiple mechanisms: reduction in intraglomerular pressure (via tubuloglomerular feedback), reduction in proteinuria, blood pressure lowering, and metabolic effects.

Key trial results: DAPA-CKD (dapagliflozin) showed a 39% reduction in the composite of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, or renal/cardiovascular death. This benefit was seen regardless of diabetes status.

EMPA-KIDNEY (empagliflozin) showed a 28% reduction in the composite of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death.

## 5. Dosing

| Agent | Starting Dose | Maximum Dose | Renal Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Empagliflozin | 10 mg daily | 25 mg daily | Initiate if eGFR 20+ (cardiorenal); 30+ (glycemic) |
| Dapagliflozin | 10 mg daily | 10 mg daily | Initiate if eGFR 20+ (CKD/HF); 25+ (glycemic) |
| Canagliflozin | 100 mg daily | 300 mg daily | Initiate if eGFR 30+ |
| Ertugliflozin | 5 mg daily | 15 mg daily | Initiate if eGFR 45+ |

Glucose-lowering efficacy diminishes as eGFR declines below 45, but cardiovascular and renal protective effects persist at lower eGFR levels.

## 6. Adverse Effects

**Common:** Genital mycotic infections (5% to 10%, more common in women), urinary tract infections (modestly increased), volume depletion, polyuria.

**Less common but important:**
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): rare but can occur, sometimes with only modestly elevated glucose ("euglycemic DKA"). Risk factors: surgery, illness, fasting, excessive alcohol, low carbohydrate diet. Withhold SGLT2 inhibitors at least 3 days before scheduled surgery.
- Acute kidney injury: typically in the setting of volume depletion. Ensure adequate hydration.
- Lower limb amputation: increased risk observed with canagliflozin in some studies. Monitor foot health.
- Fournier gangrene (necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum): very rare but serious. Counsel patients on symptoms.

## 7. Monitoring

- Renal function: at baseline, within 3 months of initiation, then at least annually
- Blood pressure: may decrease by 3 to 5 mmHg systolic; adjust antihypertensives if needed
- Volume status: particularly in elderly patients or those on diuretics
- Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis, particularly during illness
- Genital and urinary symptoms at follow-up visits
