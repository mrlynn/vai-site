# ACE Inhibitor Prescribing Reference

**Document ID:** DR-CARD-2025-001
**Classification:** Drug Reference
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## 1. Class Overview

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, reducing vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion, and sodium retention. They provide blood pressure lowering, cardiovascular protection, and renal protective effects, particularly in patients with proteinuria.

**Available agents:** lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril, benazepril, captopril, fosinopril, quinapril, perindopril.

## 2. Indications

- Hypertension (first-line)
- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (target dose: see GDMT protocol)
- Post-myocardial infarction (within 24 hours if hemodynamically stable)
- Diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria
- Chronic kidney disease with proteinuria (ACR greater than 30 mg/g)
- Cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk patients

## 3. Dosing

| Agent | Starting Dose | Target Dose | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lisinopril | 5 to 10 mg | 40 mg | Once daily |
| Enalapril | 2.5 to 5 mg | 20 mg | Twice daily |
| Ramipril | 1.25 to 2.5 mg | 10 mg | Once daily |
| Captopril | 6.25 to 12.5 mg | 50 mg | Three times daily |

Start at the lower end of the dosing range in: elderly patients, patients with renal impairment, patients on diuretics, patients with heart failure (risk of first-dose hypotension).

Titrate every 1 to 2 weeks to target dose as tolerated. If hypotension limits titration, consider reducing diuretic dose first.

## 4. Renal Protective Effects

ACE inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure by dilating the efferent arteriole of the glomerulus, thereby reducing proteinuria and slowing the progression of diabetic and non-diabetic CKD. These effects are most pronounced in patients with albuminuria (ACR greater than 30 mg/g).

The renal protective benefit is independent of blood pressure lowering, though optimal blood pressure control (less than 130/80 mmHg) provides additional benefit.

## 5. Renal Monitoring

**Baseline:** Serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium before starting therapy.

**Follow-up:** Check serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation or any dose increase.

**Acceptable changes:**
- A rise in serum creatinine of up to 30% from baseline is expected and acceptable. This reflects the hemodynamic effect on the glomerulus, not renal damage.
- If creatinine rises more than 30%, consider: volume depletion, NSAID use, bilateral renal artery stenosis, or heart failure exacerbation.

**Discontinue if:**
- Creatinine rises more than 30% and does not stabilize after addressing reversible causes
- Potassium exceeds 5.5 mEq/L despite dietary modification and diuretic adjustment
- Angioedema occurs (switch to ARB with caution, as cross-reactivity is rare but possible)

## 6. Contraindications

- Known hypersensitivity or history of angioedema with ACE inhibitor
- Bilateral renal artery stenosis (or stenosis in a solitary kidney)
- Pregnancy (teratogenic in all trimesters)
- Severe hyperkalemia (potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L)
- Concurrent use with sacubitril/valsartan (allow 36-hour washout)
- Concurrent use with another ACE inhibitor or ARB (dual RAAS blockade not recommended)

## 7. Common Adverse Effects

- Dry cough (5% to 20%): class effect related to bradykinin accumulation. If persistent, switch to ARB
- Hyperkalemia: risk increased with renal impairment, diabetes, potassium-sparing diuretics, and potassium supplements
- Hypotension: especially first-dose hypotension in volume-depleted patients
- Dizziness, headache
- Angioedema (less than 1%): life-threatening, requires permanent discontinuation of ACE inhibitors
- Dysgeusia (altered taste): more common with captopril

## 8. Drug Interactions

- NSAIDs: reduce antihypertensive effect and increase risk of renal impairment and hyperkalemia
- Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone): increased hyperkalemia risk; monitor potassium closely
- Lithium: ACE inhibitors increase lithium levels; monitor lithium concentration
- Aliskiren: avoid concurrent use (dual RAAS blockade)
