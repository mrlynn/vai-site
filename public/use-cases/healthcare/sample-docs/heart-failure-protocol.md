# Heart Failure Management Protocol

**Document ID:** CG-CARD-2025-002
**Effective Date:** January 15, 2025
**Review Date:** January 15, 2026
**Department:** Cardiology, Internal Medicine
**Approved By:** Heart Failure Program Committee

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This protocol standardizes the evaluation, classification, and pharmacologic management of heart failure (HF) across all inpatient and outpatient settings within the hospital system. It applies to adult patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed or established heart failure.

## 2. Classification by Ejection Fraction

Heart failure is categorized by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as follows:

- **HFrEF (Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction):** LVEF less than or equal to 40%
- **HFmrEF (Heart Failure with Mildly Reduced Ejection Fraction):** LVEF 41% to 49%
- **HFpEF (Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction):** LVEF greater than or equal to 50%

All patients should have baseline echocardiography within 48 hours of presentation or at the time of initial diagnosis.

## 3. NYHA Functional Classification

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| I | No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary activity does not cause symptoms. |
| II | Slight limitation. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary activity results in fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea. |
| III | Marked limitation. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes symptoms. |
| IV | Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms may be present at rest. |

## 4. Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF

### 4.1 The Four Pillars of GDMT

All patients with HFrEF should be initiated on the following four medication classes unless contraindicated. Simultaneous initiation is preferred when hemodynamics permit.

**Pillar 1: Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) Inhibition**

- Preferred: Sacubitril/valsartan (ARNI), starting dose 24/26 mg BID, target dose 97/103 mg BID
- Alternative: Enalapril 2.5 mg BID, target 10-20 mg BID; or lisinopril 5 mg daily, target 20-40 mg daily
- If ACEi/ARB intolerant: Hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate combination
- Note: Allow a 36-hour washout period when switching from ACEi to ARNI

**Pillar 2: Beta-Blocker Therapy**

- Carvedilol 3.125 mg BID, target 25 mg BID (50 mg BID if weight greater than 85 kg)
- Metoprolol succinate 12.5-25 mg daily, target 200 mg daily
- Bisoprolol 1.25 mg daily, target 10 mg daily
- Do not initiate during acute decompensation. Stable euvolemia is required before starting.

**Pillar 3: Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist (MRA)**

- Spironolactone 12.5-25 mg daily, target 25-50 mg daily
- Eplerenone 25 mg daily, target 50 mg daily
- Contraindications: eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2, serum potassium greater than 5.0 mEq/L
- Monitor potassium and renal function within 1 week of initiation, then at 1 month, then every 3 months

**Pillar 4: SGLT2 Inhibitor**

- Dapagliflozin 10 mg daily or empagliflozin 10 mg daily
- Benefit demonstrated regardless of diabetes status
- Hold if eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73m2
- Common side effects: genital mycotic infections, volume depletion

### 4.2 Uptitration Schedule

- Double the dose of each agent every 1 to 2 weeks as tolerated
- Target doses should be achieved within 3 to 6 months
- Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, renal function, and electrolytes at each dose adjustment
- Hold uptitration if systolic blood pressure is below 90 mmHg, heart rate is below 55 bpm, or the patient reports symptomatic hypotension

## 5. Management of HFpEF

Evidence-based pharmacotherapy for HFpEF is more limited. The following are recommended:

- SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin): Class I recommendation
- Diuretics for volume management as needed
- Treat underlying comorbidities aggressively: hypertension (target BP less than 130/80), atrial fibrillation (rate or rhythm control), coronary artery disease, obesity
- MRA may be considered, particularly in patients with elevated natriuretic peptides
- ARB or ARNI may be considered based on clinical context

## 6. Volume Management and Diuretic Therapy

### 6.1 Acute Decompensation

- IV furosemide is the first-line loop diuretic. Initial dose: 20-40 mg IV if diuretic-naive, or 1 to 2.5 times the home oral dose given IV
- Assess urine output within 2 hours. If less than 100-150 mL/hour, double the dose
- If refractory to high-dose loop diuretics, add metolazone 2.5-5 mg orally 30 minutes before the loop diuretic (sequential nephron blockade)
- Target net negative fluid balance of 1 to 2 liters per day in most patients

### 6.2 Chronic Maintenance

- Transition to oral furosemide, torsemide, or bumetanide once euvolemic
- Torsemide may offer more reliable bioavailability than furosemide
- Instruct patients on daily weights and flexible diuretic dosing
- Sodium restriction to less than 2 grams per day

## 7. Monitoring Parameters

| Parameter | Frequency (Outpatient) | Frequency (Inpatient) |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| BMP (electrolytes, creatinine) | Every 1-2 weeks during titration, then every 3-6 months | Daily |
| BNP or NT-proBNP | At baseline, reassess with clinical change | At admission and before discharge |
| Daily weight | Daily by patient at home | Daily |
| Vital signs | Each clinic visit | Every 4-8 hours |
| Echocardiography | Repeat at 3-6 months after optimization, then annually | As clinically indicated |

## 8. Referral Criteria for Advanced Heart Failure

Consider referral to the Advanced Heart Failure team for the following:

- Persistent NYHA Class III-IV symptoms despite optimized GDMT
- Two or more heart failure hospitalizations in the past 12 months
- Need for continuous or intermittent inotropic support
- Consideration for mechanical circulatory support or transplant evaluation
- eGFR progressively declining below 30 mL/min/1.73m2 attributed to cardiorenal syndrome
