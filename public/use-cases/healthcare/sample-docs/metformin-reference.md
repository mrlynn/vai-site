# Metformin Prescribing Reference

**Document ID:** DR-ENDO-2025-001
**Classification:** Drug Reference
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## 1. Indications

Metformin hydrochloride is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is the recommended first-line pharmacologic agent for most patients unless contraindicated.

## 2. Mechanism of Action

Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy.

## 3. Dosing

**Immediate-release formulation:**
- Starting dose: 500 mg once daily with the evening meal, or 500 mg twice daily with meals
- Titration: increase by 500 mg weekly as tolerated
- Maximum dose: 2,550 mg daily (typically 850 mg three times daily or 1,000 mg twice daily)
- Usual effective dose: 1,500 to 2,000 mg daily

**Extended-release formulation:**
- Starting dose: 500 mg once daily with the evening meal
- Titration: increase by 500 mg weekly
- Maximum dose: 2,000 mg once daily

## 4. Contraindications

**Absolute contraindications:**
- eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m2
- Known hypersensitivity to metformin
- Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis
- Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function: dehydration, severe infection, shock, acute heart failure

**Relative contraindications:**
- eGFR 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73m2: do not initiate; may continue at reduced dose if already established
- Hepatic impairment (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal)
- Excessive alcohol intake (increased risk of lactic acidosis)

## 5. Renal Dosing Adjustments

| eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| 45 or greater | No dose adjustment needed |
| 30 to 44 | Do not initiate. If already on therapy, reduce to max 1,000 mg/day |
| Below 30 | Contraindicated. Discontinue immediately |

Monitor eGFR at baseline, then at least annually. Increase monitoring frequency to every 3 to 6 months in patients with eGFR 30 to 60.

## 6. Adverse Effects

**Common (greater than 5%):** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, metallic taste. GI side effects are dose-related and often improve with time. Taking with meals and gradual dose titration reduce GI intolerance. Extended-release formulation may be better tolerated.

**Uncommon but important:** Vitamin B12 deficiency (5% to 10% of patients on long-term therapy). Screen B12 levels every 2 to 3 years. Supplement if deficient.

**Rare but serious:** Lactic acidosis. Risk is very low (approximately 3 per 100,000 patient-years) when used appropriately. Risk increases with renal impairment, hepatic disease, alcohol excess, and conditions causing tissue hypoxia.

## 7. Drug Interactions

- Alcohol: increased risk of lactic acidosis with excessive intake
- Iodinated contrast media: withhold metformin at the time of or prior to contrast administration. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours post-procedure. Resume if renal function is stable.
- Cationic drugs (cimetidine, ranolazine): may increase metformin levels through competition for renal tubular secretion
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (topiramate, zonisamide): may increase risk of lactic acidosis

## 8. Monitoring

- HbA1c: every 3 months until at target, then every 6 months
- Renal function (serum creatinine, eGFR): at baseline, then annually. More frequent monitoring in patients with eGFR 30 to 60
- Vitamin B12: at baseline and every 2 to 3 years during long-term therapy
- Hepatic function: at baseline. Repeat if clinical suspicion of liver disease
