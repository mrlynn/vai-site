## Operator

Good afternoon and welcome to the Acme Corp Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.

I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa Park, Vice President of Investor Relations.

## Lisa Park, VP Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of the risks that could affect future results.

I will now turn the call over to Sarah.

## Sarah Chen, CEO

Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I am proud to report that Acme Corp delivered a strong finish to fiscal year 2025, capping a year of significant execution and strategic progress. Let me start with the headline numbers and then discuss our priorities for 2026.

Fourth quarter revenue was $156 million, up 21% year over year and ahead of our guidance range. For the full year, revenue was $562 million, representing 22% growth over fiscal 2024. ARR exited the year at $632 million, setting a strong foundation for 2026.

Full-year gross margin was 62.3%, reflecting the dynamics we discussed last quarter around enterprise mix shift and infrastructure investment. I want to be direct: while this metric came in below our long-term target of 65% to 67%, we believe the investments we made in 2025 are creating meaningful competitive advantages that will drive superior unit economics over time.

Some additional full-year highlights. We ended the year with 674 enterprise customers, up from 498 at the start of the year. Net dollar retention was 117% for the full year, consistent with our historical range of 115% to 120%. We generated $112 million in free cash flow, representing a 20% free cash flow margin, which demonstrates the underlying cash generation strength of our business model.

Looking ahead, I want to outline three strategic priorities for fiscal 2026. First, we will drive platform expansion through continued investment in Acme Intelligence Suite and the launch of two additional product modules planned for H1 2026. Second, we will accelerate international growth, where we see significant whitespace. International revenue represented 23% of total revenue in 2025, and we believe this can reach 30% within three years. Third, we will pursue disciplined M&A to extend our platform capabilities in adjacent markets. We have an active pipeline of opportunities and a strong balance sheet to execute.

Now let me turn to capital allocation. Our board has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program, reflecting confidence in the long-term value of our stock. We plan to execute this program over the next 24 months through a combination of open market purchases and accelerated share repurchase agreements. Additionally, I am pleased to announce that the board has approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, payable beginning in Q1 2026. We believe this dividend policy is sustainable and signals the maturity and predictability of our cash flow generation.

I will now turn it over to David for the financial details and 2026 guidance.

## David Nakamura, CFO

Thank you, Sarah. Let me walk through Q4 and full-year results in more detail before turning to guidance.

Fourth quarter revenue of $156 million grew 21% year over year. Subscription revenue was $145 million, representing 93% of total revenue. Professional services revenue was $11 million, reflecting our continued strategic effort to shift implementation work to our certified partner ecosystem.

Q4 gross margin was 61.8%, which included approximately $2.4 million of one-time costs related to data center migration. Normalizing for this item, adjusted gross margin was 63.3%, broadly consistent with Q3. For the full year, gross margin was 62.3% compared to 65.8% in fiscal 2024.

Full-year operating expenses were $283 million, or 50.3% of revenue. R&D was $124 million (22.1% of revenue), sales and marketing was $116 million (20.6% of revenue), and G&A was $43 million (7.7% of revenue). Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $67.4 million, representing a 12.0% operating margin.

Free cash flow for Q4 was $34.2 million, and full-year free cash flow was $112 million. We ended the year with $512 million in cash and short-term investments and zero debt.

Now for fiscal 2026 guidance. We expect full-year revenue of $670 million to $690 million, representing 19% to 23% growth. We expect gross margin for the full year in the range of 63% to 65%, with improvement weighted toward the second half as pricing actions take effect and infrastructure optimization efforts mature. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 13% to 15% for the full year, reflecting operating leverage as we scale. Free cash flow margin is expected to be 20% to 22%.

For Q1 2026 specifically, we expect revenue of $160 million to $164 million and non-GAAP operating margin of 11% to 13%. The first quarter will reflect the seasonal dynamics of annual enterprise renewals and the initial ramp of new pricing.

With respect to margin expansion in the second half of 2026, let me provide some additional context. We expect three factors to drive improvement. First, the full-period impact of our January pricing adjustments, which affect approximately 40% of our subscription base on annual renewal cycles. Second, the completion of our cloud infrastructure consolidation, which we expect to reduce hosting costs by 15% to 20% on a per-unit basis. Third, natural operating leverage as revenue scales without proportional headcount growth in support functions.

## Question and Answer Session

**Analyst, Bank of America:** David, on the $500 million buyback, what is the expected cadence? And how should we think about the balance between buybacks and potential M&A?

**David Nakamura:** We expect to execute approximately $200 million to $250 million in the first 12 months, with the remainder over the subsequent 12 months. The cadence will be influenced by share price levels and market conditions. Regarding the balance with M&A, we view these as complementary rather than competing priorities. Our strong cash flow generation of over $100 million annually, combined with our unlevered balance sheet, gives us ample capacity to pursue both. We would consider modest leverage for a transformational acquisition, but our base plan assumes the buyback and dividend are fully funded from operating cash flow.

**Analyst, UBS:** Sarah, can you elaborate on the international opportunity? What geographies are you prioritizing and what investment is required?

**Sarah Chen:** We are focused on three regions: Western Europe, where we already have meaningful traction with revenue growing 35% year over year; Japan, where we established a direct sales presence in mid-2025 and are seeing strong early pipeline; and Australia/New Zealand, where we plan to expand our go-to-market team in Q2 2026. The investment profile is moderate. We are leveraging our existing platform architecture, which supports multi-region deployment, and partnering with local system integrators to reduce the capital intensity of geographic expansion. We expect international revenue to contribute approximately 26% to 28% of total revenue in fiscal 2026.

**Analyst, Citi:** Can you talk about the competitive landscape and whether the new AI capabilities are changing the dynamics?

**Sarah Chen:** The launch of Acme Intelligence Suite has been a significant differentiator. In Q4, 38% of new enterprise deals included the Intelligence Suite as part of the initial deployment, compared to just 12% in Q3 when the product first launched. We are seeing this capability increasingly become a requirement in RFP processes, which plays to our advantage given our 18-month head start relative to the nearest competitor. Win rates in deals where Intelligence Suite was evaluated were 71%, approximately 10 points above our overall average. We expect AI-driven capabilities to become a more important factor in vendor selection throughout 2026.

**Analyst, Deutsche Bank:** David, the 2026 gross margin guidance implies significant expansion in H2. What gives you confidence in hitting 65% in the back half?

**David Nakamura:** The confidence comes from three data points. First, we have already contracted infrastructure optimization agreements with our primary cloud providers that lock in the per-unit cost reductions I mentioned. These are not aspirational; they are contractual. Second, our January pricing increases are live and the early renewal data is tracking in line with our models, both in terms of price realization and retention. Third, the enterprise cohort that onboarded in 2024 is now entering the higher-margin phase of their lifecycle, and this cohort represents a meaningful share of ARR. When we model these inputs together, we see a clear path to the upper end of our gross margin guidance range by Q4 2026.

**Operator:** This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Sarah Chen for closing remarks.

**Sarah Chen:** Thank you all for your time today. Fiscal 2025 was a landmark year for Acme Corp. We scaled the business to over $560 million in revenue, launched transformative AI capabilities, and demonstrated our ability to generate significant free cash flow. As we enter 2026, we are well positioned to continue delivering the combination of growth and profitability that our shareholders expect. I look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks. Thank you.

**Operator:** This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
