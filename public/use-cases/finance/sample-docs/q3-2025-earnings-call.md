## Operator

Good afternoon and welcome to the Acme Corp Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa Park, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

## Lisa Park, VP Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Acme Corp's third quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Sarah Chen, our Chief Executive Officer, and David Nakamura, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, strategies, and the anticipated performance of our business. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and expectations, are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and involve assumptions that may not materialize.

With that, I will turn the call over to Sarah.

## Sarah Chen, CEO

Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Acme Corp delivered another strong quarter, with revenue of $142 million, representing 24% year-over-year growth. This result exceeded the high end of our guidance range by approximately $3 million, driven primarily by robust demand in our enterprise segment.

Let me walk you through the key highlights for the quarter. Annual recurring revenue reached $580 million at the end of Q3, up from $468 million in the year-ago period. Net dollar retention came in at 118%, reflecting healthy expansion within our existing customer base. We added 47 net new enterprise logos during the quarter, bringing our total enterprise customer count to 612.

Our platform continues to gain traction with larger organizations. During Q3, we closed 14 deals with annual contract values exceeding $1 million, compared to 9 such deals in the same period last year. The average enterprise deal size increased 18% year over year to $940,000, which reflects both deeper initial deployments and broader adoption of our premium modules.

On the product side, we launched Acme Intelligence Suite in September, our AI-powered analytics platform that integrates directly into existing customer workflows. Early adoption has been encouraging, with over 120 customers activating the product within the first four weeks. We believe this capability will be a meaningful driver of expansion revenue in coming quarters.

I also want to address the margin profile this quarter. We experienced some gross margin pressure, which David will discuss in detail. While we are not satisfied with the sequential decline, the underlying drivers are well understood, and we have a clear plan to return margins to our target range. I view this as a temporary dynamic rather than a structural shift.

I will now turn it over to David to walk through the financial details.

## David Nakamura, CFO

Thank you, Sarah. Let me provide additional detail on our Q3 financial results.

Total revenue for the third quarter was $142 million, up 24% year over year and up 8% sequentially. Subscription revenue was $131 million, representing 92% of total revenue, with the balance coming from professional services.

Gross margin for the quarter was 63.1%, compared to 63.9% in Q2 2025 and 65.2% in Q3 2024. The 80 basis point sequential decline and 210 basis point year-over-year decline were driven by three primary factors. First, higher cloud infrastructure costs as we scaled compute capacity for the Acme Intelligence Suite launch. Second, an unfavorable shift in revenue mix toward enterprise customers, who carry higher deployment and support costs during the initial contract period. Third, increased personnel costs in our customer success organization as we invested ahead of expected demand.

We anticipate gross margins will remain in the 62% to 64% range through Q4, with improvement expected in the first half of 2026 as we realize efficiencies from infrastructure optimization and pricing actions. Specifically, we plan to implement targeted price increases on select product tiers effective January 1, 2026, which we expect to contribute 100 to 150 basis points of margin improvement over the course of the year.

Operating expenses totaled $72.4 million, or 51.0% of revenue. Research and development expense was $31.2 million, or 22.0% of revenue. Sales and marketing expense was $29.8 million, or 21.0% of revenue. General and administrative expense was $11.4 million, or 8.0% of revenue.

Non-GAAP operating income was $17.2 million, representing a 12.1% operating margin. Free cash flow for the quarter was $24.8 million, with a free cash flow margin of 17.5%. We ended the quarter with $485 million in cash and short-term investments.

For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $149 million to $153 million, representing 20% to 23% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 11% to 13%.

I will now turn it back to the operator for questions.

## Question and Answer Session

**Analyst, Morgan Stanley:** Sarah, can you provide more color on the enterprise mix shift and how you expect that to evolve? Is the margin dilution from larger deals a permanent feature of the model, or do you see a path to convergence?

**Sarah Chen:** Great question. The margin dynamics we are seeing with enterprise deals are front-loaded. During the first 12 to 18 months of a large enterprise deployment, we invest more heavily in implementation support, custom integrations, and dedicated success resources. However, as these accounts mature, they typically expand into additional modules and require proportionally less support relative to their contract value. Our cohort data shows that enterprise accounts in their third year generate gross margins that are actually 200 to 300 basis points above our blended average. So while we are absorbing some near-term dilution, we view enterprise mix shift as a long-term margin tailwind.

**Analyst, Goldman Sachs:** David, on the pricing actions planned for Q1, how are you thinking about potential churn or pushback from customers? Have you done any sensitivity analysis on elasticity?

**David Nakamura:** We have done extensive analysis on this. The planned increases are focused on our mid-market and enterprise tiers, where we have the strongest value proposition and the highest switching costs. Our internal modeling suggests minimal incremental churn, in the range of 20 to 40 basis points of gross retention. The increases are modest, averaging 5% to 8% across affected tiers, and well within the range that our customer success teams have validated through direct engagement with key accounts. We are confident these actions will be well received given the product value we continue to deliver.

**Analyst, JP Morgan:** Can you talk about the competitive environment? Are you seeing any changes in win rates or deal cycles?

**Sarah Chen:** The competitive environment remains healthy. Our overall win rate in competitive evaluations has been stable at approximately 62% over the past four quarters. We have seen some elongation in enterprise deal cycles, which is consistent with the broader macroeconomic environment, but close rates once deals reach the final evaluation stage have actually improved. The launch of Acme Intelligence Suite has been a meaningful differentiator in recent evaluations. Several of our Q3 enterprise wins cited our AI capabilities as the deciding factor in their vendor selection.

**Operator:** This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Sarah Chen for closing remarks.

**Sarah Chen:** Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our Q3 results and remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained, profitable growth. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.

**Operator:** This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
