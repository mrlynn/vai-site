# Acme Corp Liquidity Management Policy

**Document ID:** FIN-LQ-2025-002
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Last Revised:** December 18, 2024
**Classification:** Internal, Confidential
**Owner:** Treasurer, Acme Corp

## 1. Liquidity Framework

Acme Corp maintains a liquidity management framework designed to ensure the company can meet all financial obligations as they come due, under both normal and stressed market conditions. The framework is governed by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and operationally managed by the Treasury team. Liquidity risk is assessed daily, with formal reporting to senior management on a weekly basis and to the Board quarterly.

The company's liquidity strategy is anchored in three principles: maintaining diversified funding sources, holding a prudent buffer of highly liquid assets, and ensuring access to contingent funding facilities that can be activated rapidly.

## 2. Minimum Reserve Requirements

Acme Corp maintains the following minimum liquidity reserves at all times:

**Operating Cash Reserves:** A minimum of $150M in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, held across diversified depository institutions. No single institution may hold more than 30% of total cash reserves. As of December 31, 2024, the company holds $187.3M in unrestricted cash, distributed across four primary banking relationships.

**Committed Credit Facility:** A $200M senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of six banks, maturing in September 2027. The facility is currently undrawn. Borrowings bear interest at SOFR plus a margin of 125 to 175 basis points, depending on leverage ratio. The facility contains financial covenants requiring a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0x (current: 8.4x) and a maximum net leverage ratio of 3.5x (current: 1.2x).

**Total Available Liquidity:** As of December 31, 2024, total available liquidity is $387.3M ($187.3M cash plus $200.0M undrawn revolver), representing approximately 14.2 months of projected operating expenses.

## 3. Liquidity Coverage Ratio

Acme Corp calculates an internal Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) defined as high-quality liquid assets divided by projected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress horizon.

**Current LCR: 2.4x** (target minimum: 1.5x)

The numerator includes unrestricted cash ($187.3M), U.S. Treasury holdings maturing within 90 days ($48.6M), and available credit facility ($200.0M), totaling $435.9M. The denominator reflects estimated 30-day net outflows of $182.1M under the base stress scenario, including payroll, vendor payments, debt service, and a conservative assumption of 15% ARR churn acceleration.

## 4. Stress Scenarios

The Treasury team models three stress scenarios on a monthly basis to validate the adequacy of liquidity reserves.

**Scenario 1: 30-Day Moderate Stress**
Assumptions: 20% acceleration in customer payment delays, 10% increase in vendor payment demands, loss of access to commercial paper market. Projected net outflows: $182.1M. Survival period with existing reserves (no facility draw): 31 days. With facility draw: 64 days.

**Scenario 2: 90-Day Severe Stress**
Assumptions: 30% decline in new bookings, 25% of customers request payment deferrals, two quarters of elevated churn (annualized churn increases from 8% to 14%), credit facility remains available. Projected cumulative net outflows: $298.4M. Available liquidity covers 116% of projected outflows without triggering covenant breaches.

**Scenario 3: Systemic Crisis**
Assumptions: Complete loss of access to capital markets, credit facility draw restricted to 50% due to syndicate bank stress, 40% decline in collections over 90 days, no new customer signings. Projected cumulative net outflows: $374.2M. Available liquidity (cash plus 50% facility) covers 77% of projected outflows. This scenario would require activation of the Contingency Funding Plan within 45 days.

## 5. Contingency Funding Plan

In the event that available liquidity falls below 1.2x the LCR target or Scenario 3 conditions are triggered, the following contingency measures are available, listed in order of priority:

1. **Asset Monetization:** Accelerated liquidation of the short-duration investment portfolio (estimated realizable value: $142.8M within 5 business days)
2. **Receivables Acceleration:** Engagement of the pre-negotiated receivables factoring facility with GreenBridge Capital (capacity: $50M, advance rate: 90%)
3. **Capex Deferral:** Immediate suspension of all non-essential capital expenditures (estimated quarterly savings: $18.5M)
4. **Headcount Actions:** Hiring freeze and targeted workforce reduction (estimated quarterly savings: $12.0M to $25.0M, depending on scope)
5. **Secured Borrowing:** Pledge of unencumbered real estate and IP assets for secured borrowing (estimated borrowing capacity: $75M to $100M)

The CFO is authorized to activate measures 1 through 3 without Board approval. Measures 4 and 5 require Board authorization.

## 6. Early Warning Indicators

The Treasury team monitors the following indicators daily, with automated alerts configured for threshold breaches:

| Indicator | Green | Amber | Red |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unrestricted Cash | > $175M | $150M to $175M | < $150M |
| LCR | > 2.0x | 1.5x to 2.0x | < 1.5x |
| Days Cash on Hand | > 120 days | 90 to 120 days | < 90 days |
| Net Cash Burn (Monthly) | < $10M | $10M to $15M | > $15M |
| Facility Utilization | < 25% | 25% to 50% | > 50% |
| Covenant Headroom | > 2.0x | 1.5x to 2.0x | < 1.5x |

Any Red indicator triggers immediate escalation to the CFO and Treasurer, with a mandatory action plan due within 48 hours. Two or more concurrent Amber indicators require a special Treasury review within one week.

As of December 31, 2024, all indicators are in the Green zone.
