**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025

## 1. AML Program Overview

Acme Corp maintains a risk-based Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance program designed to detect, prevent, and report suspected money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Although Acme Corp is primarily a B2B SaaS company rather than a financial institution, the company processes significant payment volumes through its platform and maintains customer financing arrangements that create regulatory obligations under applicable law.

The program is overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), who serves as the designated BSA Compliance Officer. The CCO reports directly to the General Counsel with a dotted-line reporting relationship to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compliance team currently consists of seven full-time professionals, including two Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (CAMS).

The program's four pillars are: internal policies and procedures, a designated compliance officer, an ongoing employee training program, and independent testing conducted by Internal Audit on an annual basis.

## 2. Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Tiers

Acme Corp applies a tiered CDD approach based on the risk profile of the customer relationship.

### 2.1 Standard Due Diligence (Tier 1)

Applied to all new customer relationships at onboarding. Requirements include:

- Verification of legal entity name, registration jurisdiction, and tax identification number
- Confirmation of business address through independent sources
- Identification of authorized signatories and key contacts
- Screening against OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, EU consolidated sanctions list, and other applicable sanctions databases
- Negative media screening through the compliance monitoring platform
- Assignment of an initial risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) based on the customer risk scoring model

Standard CDD must be completed before contract execution and platform access provisioning. Turnaround time for Tier 1 CDD is targeted at 3 business days.

### 2.2 Enhanced Due Diligence (Tier 2)

Enhanced Due Diligence is required when any of the following triggers are present:

- Customer is domiciled or operates primarily in a jurisdiction designated as high-risk by FATF or Acme Corp's internal country risk assessment
- Customer's industry is classified as elevated risk (e.g., cryptocurrency, gaming, cash-intensive businesses, precious metals)
- Customer's annual contract value exceeds $2,000,000
- Customer is a politically exposed person (PEP) or the beneficial owner includes a PEP
- Adverse media findings or prior regulatory actions identified during screening
- Customer requests unusual payment structures such as third-party payments, payments from jurisdictions unrelated to the customer's operations, or frequent changes to billing entities

EDD procedures include: detailed source-of-funds documentation, senior management approval (VP of Compliance or above), on-site or virtual due diligence visits for contracts exceeding $5,000,000, enhanced ongoing monitoring with quarterly reviews, and independent verification of beneficial ownership through third-party data providers.

## 3. Beneficial Ownership Requirements

In accordance with FinCEN's Customer Due Diligence Rule, Acme Corp collects and verifies beneficial ownership information for all legal entity customers. Beneficial owners are defined as individuals who directly or indirectly own 25% or more of the equity interests of the entity, as well as any individual with significant management responsibility (the control prong).

Beneficial ownership information must be collected at onboarding and updated at each periodic review (annually for High-risk customers, every two years for Medium, every three years for Low). Changes in ownership exceeding the 25% threshold must be reported by the customer within 30 days. Failure to provide or update beneficial ownership information may result in suspension of the customer account.

As of Q4 2024, beneficial ownership records are current for 96.2% of active customer accounts, against a target of 98%. A remediation campaign is underway to address the remaining 3.8%.

## 4. Transaction Monitoring

Acme Corp employs automated transaction monitoring using the Compliance Analytics Platform (CAP), which analyzes payment patterns, billing changes, and account activity against a library of 42 detection scenarios calibrated to the company's risk profile.

**Key Monitoring Scenarios Include:**
- Payments received from sanctioned or high-risk jurisdictions
- Rapid changes in billing entities or payment methods
- Payments significantly exceeding contracted amounts
- Structuring patterns (multiple transactions just below reporting thresholds)
- Dormant accounts with sudden reactivation and large transactions
- Payments from unrelated third parties without documented business justification

The system generates alerts that are triaged by the Compliance team within 48 hours. In Q4 2024, the system generated 287 alerts, of which 31 (10.8%) were escalated for investigation and 4 (1.4%) resulted in SAR filings.

## 5. Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Filing Criteria

Acme Corp files SARs with FinCEN when the company knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that a transaction or series of transactions:

- Involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended to disguise funds derived from illegal activity
- Is designed to evade BSA reporting or recordkeeping requirements
- Lacks a lawful purpose or is not the type of transaction the customer would normally be expected to engage in
- Involves the use of the company's platform to facilitate criminal activity

**Specific Filing Triggers:**
- Any suspicious transaction or series of related transactions aggregating $5,000 or more
- Any cash or cash-equivalent transaction exceeding $10,000 (Currency Transaction Report threshold, with SAR filing if suspicious indicators are present)
- Any transaction involving a party on the OFAC SDN list or other sanctions list (immediate filing required, with simultaneous blocking of the transaction)

SARs must be filed within 30 calendar days of the initial detection of suspicious activity. If no suspect is identified, the filing deadline extends to 60 days. The CCO reviews and approves all SAR filings before submission. In calendar year 2024, Acme Corp filed 14 SARs, compared to 11 in 2023, reflecting both increased transaction volume and enhanced detection capabilities.

## 6. Training Requirements

All employees are required to complete AML/KYC awareness training upon hiring and annually thereafter. The training program is structured by role:

**General Awareness (All Employees):** Annual 45-minute e-learning module covering AML fundamentals, red flags, and escalation procedures. Completion rate for 2024: 97.8%.

**Enhanced Training (Customer-Facing Roles):** Additional 2-hour training covering CDD procedures, sanctions screening, and documentation requirements. Applicable to Sales, Customer Success, Finance, and Legal teams. Completion rate for 2024: 99.1%.

**Specialist Training (Compliance Team):** Quarterly training sessions covering regulatory updates, case studies, typology reviews, and investigation techniques. Team members are encouraged to pursue CAMS certification, with examination fees and study materials funded by the company.

## 7. Record Retention

All records related to the AML/KYC program are retained for a minimum of 5 years from the date of the record's creation or the date of the last transaction on the account, whichever is later. This applies to:

- CDD and EDD documentation, including beneficial ownership records
- Transaction monitoring alerts and investigation workpapers
- SAR filings and supporting documentation (note: SAR filings themselves are maintained indefinitely)
- Training records and attendance logs
- Sanctions screening results
- Correspondence with regulatory authorities

Records are maintained in the company's secure compliance document management system with access restricted to authorized Compliance and Legal personnel. Destruction of records prior to the expiration of the retention period requires written approval from the CCO and General Counsel.

Acme Corp's AML/KYC program was last independently tested by Internal Audit in September 2024, with an overall rating of "Satisfactory." Two minor findings related to timeliness of periodic reviews were identified and are being remediated with a target completion date of March 31, 2025.
