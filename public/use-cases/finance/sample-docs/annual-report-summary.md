# Acme Corp (ACME) Annual Report Executive Summary: Fiscal Year 2025

**Fiscal Year Ended:** December 31, 2025

## Business Overview

Acme Corp is a leading provider of enterprise workflow automation and intelligent analytics software. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in San Francisco, California, the company delivers a cloud-native platform that enables organizations to automate complex business processes, analyze operational data, and make data-driven decisions at scale.

The company serves over 4,200 customers across a range of industries, including financial services, healthcare, technology, manufacturing, and retail. As of December 31, 2025, Acme Corp employed 3,012 people across 11 offices in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

The Acme platform consists of four core product pillars: Acme Workflow Engine, the company's flagship process automation product; Acme Data Hub, a unified data integration and management layer; Acme Intelligence Suite, an AI-powered analytics and decision-support platform launched in September 2025; and Acme Connect, an API gateway and integration marketplace with over 350 pre-built connectors.

Fiscal year 2025 revenue was $562 million, representing 22% year-over-year growth. Annual recurring revenue reached $632 million at year-end. The company generated $112 million in free cash flow and maintained a strong balance sheet with $512 million in cash and zero debt.

## Market Opportunity

The company estimates its total addressable market (TAM) at approximately $48 billion, based on third-party research from Gartner and IDC covering the enterprise workflow automation, business intelligence, and integration platform as a service (iPaaS) categories. This TAM estimate reflects the convergence of several large and growing software markets, driven by enterprise demand for digital transformation, operational efficiency, and AI-powered decision-making.

The serviceable addressable market (SAM) is estimated at $18 billion, reflecting the specific segments and geographies where Acme Corp actively competes today. The company's current market share within its SAM is approximately 3.5%, indicating significant room for continued penetration.

Key market trends supporting long-term growth include the accelerating adoption of AI and machine learning in business applications, growing regulatory requirements driving demand for auditable and automated workflows, continued migration of enterprise workloads to the cloud, and increasing demand for real-time data analytics and operational intelligence.

## Competitive Landscape

Acme Corp competes across several software categories and faces competition from a diverse set of vendors. The competitive landscape includes large diversified software companies such as Salesforce, Microsoft, and ServiceNow, which offer overlapping capabilities within broader platform ecosystems. The company also competes with specialized workflow automation vendors, business intelligence platforms, and integration middleware providers.

The company differentiates through several key advantages: a unified platform architecture that eliminates the need for multiple point solutions, deep vertical expertise in regulated industries, an open API ecosystem with an extensive connector marketplace, and, increasingly, proprietary AI capabilities through the Intelligence Suite.

Customer switching costs are significant due to deep integration with enterprise data systems, custom workflow configurations, and organizational adoption. The company's net dollar retention rate of 117% for fiscal 2025 reflects the stickiness of the platform and the ability to expand within existing accounts.

## Growth Strategy

The company's growth strategy is built on four pillars.

**Land and Expand:** Acme Corp employs a product-led growth motion for initial adoption, complemented by enterprise sales for expansion. The average enterprise customer expands their contract value by 35% to 45% over the first three years. The company plans to enhance self-service capabilities and invest in product-led growth initiatives targeting mid-market buyers.

**International Expansion:** International revenue represented 23% of total revenue in fiscal 2025, up from 19% in fiscal 2024. The company sees meaningful opportunity in Western Europe, Japan, and Australia/New Zealand. Planned investments include establishing direct sales operations in Tokyo and Sydney, expanding the European partner ecosystem, and achieving data residency certifications for key markets.

**Product Innovation:** The company plans to invest approximately 22% to 23% of revenue in research and development in fiscal 2026. Key investment areas include expanding AI and machine learning capabilities within the Intelligence Suite, developing industry-specific solution templates, enhancing the developer platform and API ecosystem, and strengthening security and compliance features for regulated industries.

**Strategic M&A:** The company intends to pursue selective acquisitions that extend platform capabilities, accelerate entry into adjacent markets, or add differentiated technology talent. The company's strong balance sheet and cash flow generation provide significant capacity for inorganic growth. During fiscal 2025, the company evaluated over 40 potential acquisition targets and expects to complete one to two transactions in fiscal 2026.
