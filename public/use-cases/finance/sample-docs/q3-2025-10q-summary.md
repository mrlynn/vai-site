## Risk Factors

The company updated the following risk factors during the quarter.

### Customer Concentration

The company's top 10 customers represented approximately 18% of total ARR as of September 30, 2025, compared to 15% in the prior-year period. While no single customer accounted for more than 3% of ARR, the increasing contribution from large enterprise accounts introduces greater concentration risk. The loss of, or significant reduction in spending by, one or more of these customers could adversely impact revenue and operating results.

### Competitive Environment

The market for enterprise workflow automation and analytics software remains highly competitive. The company faces competition from large, diversified technology companies with significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. Several competitors have announced or launched AI-powered analytics capabilities that compete directly with Acme Intelligence Suite. The company's ability to maintain its competitive position depends on continued innovation, effective go-to-market execution, and customer satisfaction.

### Regulatory and Compliance

The company is subject to an evolving regulatory landscape, including data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and emerging state-level privacy laws. The company also faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to AI governance and the use of automated decision-making systems. Compliance with these regulations requires ongoing investment and could limit the functionality or deployment of certain product features.

### Cloud Infrastructure Dependency

The company relies on third-party cloud infrastructure providers, primarily Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, for the delivery of its products. Any disruption, security breach, or material change in the terms or pricing of these services could adversely impact the company's operations, cost structure, and ability to serve customers.

### Macroeconomic Conditions

Continued macroeconomic uncertainty, including elevated interest rates, persistent inflation, and geopolitical instability, may impact customer purchasing decisions, particularly for discretionary technology investments. The company has observed modest elongation of enterprise sales cycles, which it attributes in part to these macroeconomic factors.

## Legal Proceedings

The company is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, the company may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
