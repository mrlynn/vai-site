# Acme Corp Risk Committee Quarterly Report: Q3 2025

**Report Date:** October 15, 2025
**Prepared By:** Office of the Chief Risk Officer
**Distribution:** Board Risk Committee, Executive Leadership Team
**Classification:** Internal, Confidential

## Risk Appetite Statement

Acme Corp maintains a moderate overall risk appetite, consistent with the company's growth objectives and commitment to long-term shareholder value. The company accepts measured risks in pursuit of innovation and market expansion while maintaining conservative thresholds for operational, financial, and compliance risk categories. The Board Risk Committee reviews and affirms the risk appetite framework annually, with the most recent affirmation completed on March 12, 2025.

The company's risk tolerance is defined across three tiers. Tier 1 (zero tolerance) applies to regulatory violations, data breaches involving customer PII, and financial reporting integrity. Tier 2 (low tolerance) applies to operational disruptions exceeding 4 hours, customer concentration above 40% of ARR in the top 5 accounts, and credit exposure above established thresholds. Tier 3 (moderate tolerance) applies to revenue volatility within guidance ranges, competitive market dynamics, and technology adoption risks.

## Overall Risk Assessment

The aggregate risk profile for Q3 2025 is **Medium-High**, an increase from the Medium rating assigned in Q2 2025. The elevation reflects increased concentration risk in the top customer cohort, heightened regulatory uncertainty, and rising cybersecurity threat activity. No Tier 1 risk events occurred during the quarter.

## Top Risk Summary

| Customer Concentration | High | Worsening | Medium-High |
| Regulatory Uncertainty | High | Stable | High |
| Cybersecurity | Medium-High | Worsening | Medium |
| Interest Rate / Market | Medium | Stable | Medium |
| Vendor Dependency | Medium | Stable | Medium |
| Talent Retention | Medium | Improving | Medium-High |
| Competitive | Medium | Stable | Medium |

## Detailed Risk Assessments

### 1. Customer Concentration Risk: HIGH

**Description:** The company's top 5 customers represented 34% of total ARR as of September 30, 2025, compared to 28% at the end of Q2 2025 and 24% at the end of Q3 2024. This increase was driven by significant contract expansions with two enterprise accounts during Q3, each exceeding $15 million in ARR. While these expansions reflect strong product-market fit and customer satisfaction, the resulting concentration introduces material revenue risk in the event of customer loss, downsizing, or delayed renewal.

**Risk Drivers:**
- Two individual customers now each represent more than 5% of ARR
- The top 5 customer cohort has a weighted average contract expiration of 14 months
- Industry concentration within the top 5 is elevated, with 3 of 5 in the financial services sector

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Implement multi-year contract incentive program targeting top 10 accounts, with 3-year minimum terms and early renewal discounts (Owner: VP Enterprise Sales, Target: Q4 2025)
- Accelerate mid-market and SMB pipeline development to improve revenue diversification (Owner: CRO, Target: Ongoing)
- Establish quarterly executive sponsorship reviews for all accounts exceeding 3% of ARR (Owner: CEO, Target: Immediate)
- Develop scenario analysis and contingency plans for the loss of any top-5 customer (Owner: CFO, Target: Q4 2025)

### 2. Regulatory Uncertainty: HIGH

**Description:** The regulatory environment for enterprise software companies continues to evolve rapidly. The SEC's proposed climate disclosure rules, if finalized in their current form, would require the company to report Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, with third-party attestation requirements beginning in 2027. Separately, the EU AI Act will impose compliance obligations on the company's Acme Intelligence Suite product as deployed within EU member states. Several U.S. states have also introduced or enacted comprehensive data privacy laws that will take effect in 2026.

**Risk Drivers:**
- SEC climate rules could require significant investment in emissions measurement and reporting infrastructure
- EU AI Act compliance may require modifications to AI model transparency and audit capabilities
- Compliance costs across all regulatory workstreams are estimated at $4M to $7M annually
- Regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions increases operational complexity

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Engage external regulatory counsel to conduct compliance gap assessment for EU AI Act (Owner: General Counsel, Target: Q4 2025)
- Establish cross-functional regulatory readiness working group with representatives from Legal, Product, Engineering, and Finance (Owner: Chief Risk Officer, Target: Immediate)
- Allocate $2.5M in the FY2026 budget for regulatory compliance programs (Owner: CFO, Target: Q1 2026 budget cycle)
- Begin voluntary Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reporting in the FY2025 annual report to build organizational readiness (Owner: VP Operations, Target: Q1 2026)

### 3. Cybersecurity Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Description:** The company experienced a 45% increase in detected intrusion attempts during Q3 2025 compared to the prior quarter. While no successful breaches occurred, the threat landscape has intensified, with sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting employees with access to customer data and production environments. The expansion of the Acme Intelligence Suite product surface area has introduced additional vectors that require ongoing security assessment.

**Risk Drivers:**
- Increased attack frequency and sophistication targeting SaaS platforms
- Expanded product surface area from Intelligence Suite launch
- 23% of employees completed security awareness training late or not at all in Q3
- Third-party component vulnerability disclosures increased 30% year over year

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Implement mandatory security awareness training with quarterly certification requirements and consequences for non-compliance (Owner: CISO, Target: Q4 2025)
- Complete penetration testing of Acme Intelligence Suite by an independent third-party firm (Owner: CISO, Target: November 2025)
- Deploy enhanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities across all employee devices (Owner: VP IT, Target: Q4 2025)
- Increase bug bounty program rewards by 50% to incentivize external vulnerability discovery (Owner: CISO, Target: Immediate)

### 4. Interest Rate and Market Risk: MEDIUM

**Description:** The company's investment portfolio, consisting primarily of investment-grade fixed-income securities, is subject to interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2025, the portfolio had a duration of 1.8 years and a market value of $485 million. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated unrealized loss of approximately $8.7 million. The company does not hold any speculative financial instruments and has no variable-rate debt obligations.

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Maintain portfolio duration below 2.0 years to limit interest rate sensitivity (Owner: Treasurer, Ongoing)
- Invest new cash flows in shorter-duration instruments to reduce portfolio duration over the next two quarters (Owner: Treasurer, Target: Q1 2026)
- Quarterly mark-to-market review presented to Audit Committee (Owner: CFO, Ongoing)

### 5. Vendor Dependency Risk: MEDIUM

**Description:** The company relies on Amazon Web Services (62% of hosting) and Google Cloud Platform (38% of hosting) for core infrastructure. Combined annual cloud spending exceeded $48 million in the trailing twelve months. While the company maintains a multi-cloud architecture, certain product features, including components of the Intelligence Suite, are currently available only on AWS due to proprietary service dependencies.

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Complete portability assessment for all AWS-specific service dependencies (Owner: VP Engineering, Target: Q1 2026)
- Negotiate multi-year committed-use agreements with both providers to secure pricing stability (Owner: VP Operations, Target: Q4 2025)
- Maintain disaster recovery capabilities with a maximum recovery time objective of 4 hours across both cloud environments (Owner: VP Engineering, Ongoing)
- Evaluate the feasibility of adding a third cloud provider for non-production workloads (Owner: CTO, Target: H1 2026)

## Recommendations to the Board

1. Approve the proposed customer concentration risk mitigation plan, including multi-year contract incentive structures and enhanced executive sponsorship protocols.
2. Authorize the allocation of $2.5 million in the fiscal 2026 operating budget for regulatory compliance readiness programs.
3. Mandate completion of cybersecurity awareness training for 100% of employees by December 31, 2025, with individual accountability measures for non-compliance.
4. Request management to present an updated vendor dependency risk assessment, including a multi-cloud portability roadmap, at the Q1 2026 Board meeting.

## Next Review

The next quarterly risk review is scheduled for January 14, 2026. An interim review may be convened if any Tier 1 risk event occurs or if the aggregate risk profile escalates to High.
