# Acme Corp Capital Allocation Strategy Memo: FY2026

**From:** David Park, Chief Financial Officer
**To:** Board of Directors
**Date:** December 18, 2025
**Subject:** FY2026 Capital Allocation Framework
**Classification:** Confidential, Board Materials

## Executive Summary

This memo outlines the proposed capital allocation framework for fiscal year 2026. With projected free cash flow of $130 million to $145 million and a cash balance of $438 million, Acme is well positioned to balance shareholder returns, strategic investment, and financial flexibility. The proposed framework allocates capital across four priorities: organic growth investment, shareholder returns (dividends and buybacks), strategic M&A, and balance sheet strength.

## Current Capital Position

As of December 31, 2025:
- Cash and short-term investments: $438 million
- Outstanding debt: $0
- Undrawn revolving credit facility: $200 million
- Projected FY2026 free cash flow: $130M to $145M
- Total available capital: approximately $770M to $785M

## FY2026 Capital Allocation Framework

### 1. Organic Growth Investment ($85M to $95M)

**R&D Investment:** $70M to $78M (approximately 10% to 11% of projected revenue). Key investment areas include the AI insights engine (next-generation capabilities), platform scalability and performance, compliance and security modules, and developer API platform expansion.

**Go-to-Market Expansion:** $15M to $17M incremental investment in international expansion (UK and Germany direct presence), channel partner program scaling, and enterprise sales capacity.

### 2. Shareholder Returns ($95M to $110M)

**Quarterly Dividend:** $0.35 per share ($1.40 annualized), representing approximately $42 million annually. Current yield: approximately 1.2% at recent share price of $118. The Board has maintained the dividend at this level for six consecutive quarters. We recommend maintaining the current rate through 2026, with a reassessment in Q4 2026 based on cash flow trajectory.

**Share Repurchase Program:** The Board approved a new $500 million share repurchase authorization in Q4 2025. We recommend deploying $50M to $65M of this authorization in 2026, executed through a combination of open-market purchases and an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. Repurchase activity will be calibrated based on share price, trading volume, and cash flow timing.

Combined with the dividend, total shareholder returns of $92M to $107M represent approximately 60% of projected free cash flow, consistent with our stated target of returning 50% to 70% of FCF to shareholders.

### 3. Strategic M&A ($200M Reserved)

We recommend reserving $200 million for strategic acquisitions in 2026. The M&A pipeline currently includes six active targets in various stages of evaluation.

**Acquisition Criteria:**
- Revenue run-rate: $10M to $50M
- Strategic fit: must accelerate product roadmap or expand addressable market
- Technology quality: production-grade with demonstrated scalability
- Financial hurdle: minimum 15% unlevered IRR over 5-year projection
- Cultural alignment: product-led, engineering-driven organizations preferred
- Integration complexity: target 90-day integration plan for all acquisitions

**Priority Areas:**
1. AI/ML capabilities (natural language processing, predictive analytics)
2. Vertical-specific solutions (healthcare analytics, financial compliance)
3. International distribution (European market access)

### 4. Balance Sheet Strength

**Minimum Cash Reserve:** $200M. This provides approximately 18 months of operating expenses at current run-rate, ensuring resilience through potential economic disruptions.

**Credit Facility:** Maintain the existing $200M undrawn revolving credit facility as additional liquidity backstop. Current terms: SOFR + 125bps, renewed through June 2028.

**Capital Structure Target:** Net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0x to 1.5x. We currently operate at 0x (no debt). Moderate leverage could be employed for a transformative acquisition, but organic operations should remain self-funding.

## Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | FCF | Dividend | Buyback | M&A | End Cash |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Base Case | $137M | $42M | $58M | $75M | $400M |
| Upside (beat guidance) | $155M | $42M | $70M | $100M | $381M |
| Downside (macro slowdown) | $105M | $42M | $30M | $0 | $471M |
| Large Acquisition | $137M | $42M | $25M | $200M | $308M |

In all scenarios, ending cash remains above the $200M minimum reserve, and the capital structure remains investment-grade quality.

## Recommendation

The proposed framework balances returning capital to shareholders with maintaining flexibility for strategic opportunities. Key decision points during the year will include: Q1 Board meeting to review M&A pipeline and authorize specific transactions, Q2 reassessment of buyback pace based on share price performance, and Q4 dividend review based on full-year results and 2027 outlook.

We recommend the Board approve this framework at the January 2026 meeting, with quarterly reviews as part of the standard Board Risk Committee agenda.
