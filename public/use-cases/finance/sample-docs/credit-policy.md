**Document ID:** FIN-CP-2025-003
**Effective Date:** January 15, 2025
**Last Revised:** January 10, 2025
**Classification:** Internal, Confidential
**Owner:** Office of the Chief Financial Officer

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for extending credit to counterparties, customers, and business partners of Acme Corp (NASDAQ: ACME). It defines approval authorities, risk assessment criteria, concentration limits, and ongoing monitoring requirements to ensure that credit exposures remain within the company's risk appetite. All credit decisions must balance revenue growth objectives with prudent risk management, consistent with Acme Corp's enterprise risk framework.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all forms of credit exposure, including but not limited to: accounts receivable from SaaS subscription and services contracts, deferred payment arrangements, channel partner financing, vendor prepayments exceeding $250,000, and any off-balance-sheet credit commitments. All business units, subsidiaries, and joint ventures operating under the Acme Corp umbrella are subject to these requirements.

## 3. Credit Approval Authority

Credit approval authority is tiered based on the aggregate exposure to any single counterparty, inclusive of all existing and proposed commitments.

### 3.1 Tier Structure

| Approval Tier | Aggregate Exposure Limit | Approving Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | Up to $1,000,000 | Regional Credit Manager |
| Tier 2 | $1,000,001 to $5,000,000 | Vice President, Finance |
| Tier 3 | $5,000,001 to $10,000,000 | Chief Financial Officer |
| Tier 4 | Greater than $10,000,000 | Board Risk Committee |

### 3.2 Delegation and Escalation

No individual may approve credit exposures that exceed their designated tier. In cases where the primary approver is unavailable, authority may be temporarily delegated to the next higher tier. All Tier 3 and Tier 4 approvals require a written credit memorandum prepared by the Credit Risk team, including a quantitative risk assessment and recommended terms.

Tier 4 approvals require a minimum of five business days for Board Risk Committee review, except in cases where the CFO certifies that expedited review is necessary to prevent material business disruption.

## 4. Credit Assessment Criteria

All credit decisions must incorporate the following assessment factors:

**Financial Analysis:** Review of the counterparty's most recent audited financial statements (not older than 18 months), including profitability trends, leverage ratios, and cash flow adequacy. Minimum acceptable current ratio is 1.2x for Tier 1 exposures and 1.5x for Tier 2 and above.

**Credit Ratings:** External credit ratings from at least one recognized agency (S&P, Moody's, Fitch) are required for exposures exceeding $2,000,000. Counterparties rated below BB/Ba2 require enhanced due diligence and CFO approval regardless of exposure size.

**Payment History:** Internal payment history is weighted heavily. Counterparties with more than two instances of payment beyond 60 days in the preceding 12 months are flagged for enhanced review. New counterparties without payment history require a 50% deposit or letter of credit for initial engagements exceeding $500,000.

**Industry and Geographic Risk:** The Credit Risk team maintains country risk ratings and industry risk scores updated quarterly. Exposures to counterparties in high-risk jurisdictions require EDD review per the AML/KYC compliance program.

## 5. Concentration Limits

To mitigate portfolio concentration risk, the following limits are enforced:

**Single Counterparty Limit:** No single counterparty (including affiliates and related entities) may represent more than 10% of total outstanding credit exposure. As of Q4 2024, the largest single counterparty exposure is NovaTech Solutions at 8.7% of the total portfolio ($14.2M of $163.4M aggregate exposure).

**Industry Concentration:** No single industry vertical may represent more than 25% of total credit exposure. Current concentrations: Technology (22.3%), Healthcare (18.1%), Financial Services (15.7%), Manufacturing (12.4%), Other (31.5%).

**Geographic Concentration:** Domestic (U.S.) exposure shall not exceed 70% of the total portfolio. International exposure to any single country shall not exceed 15%. Current domestic concentration stands at 64.8%.

Breaches of concentration limits must be reported to the CFO within two business days and remediated within 90 days through portfolio rebalancing, credit insurance, or counterparty diversification.

## 6. Monitoring and Review

**Ongoing Monitoring:** The Credit Risk team performs monthly portfolio reviews, including aging analysis, watchlist updates, and covenant compliance checks. Counterparties on the watchlist are reviewed bi-weekly.

**Annual Reviews:** All exposures exceeding $1,000,000 undergo a full annual credit review, including updated financial analysis and re-rating. Tier 3 and Tier 4 exposures require semi-annual reviews.

**Early Warning Indicators:** The following triggers require immediate escalation to the VP of Finance: counterparty credit rating downgrade of two or more notches, missed payment exceeding 30 days on an exposure greater than $500,000, adverse material litigation or regulatory action, or significant deterioration in the counterparty's publicly reported financial metrics.

## 7. Collections Process

**Standard Collections:** Past-due accounts are subject to the following escalation timeline: 15 days past due, automated reminder; 30 days past due, direct outreach by account management; 45 days past due, formal demand letter from the Credit Risk team; 60 days past due, engagement of external collections counsel.

**Provisioning:** Accounts exceeding 90 days past due are provisioned at 50% of outstanding value. Accounts exceeding 180 days past due are provisioned at 100% and referred for write-off consideration, subject to CFO approval.

**Write-Off Authority:** Write-offs up to $250,000 may be approved by the VP of Finance. Write-offs exceeding $250,000 require CFO approval. Write-offs exceeding $1,000,000 require Board Risk Committee approval. All write-offs are reported in the quarterly risk report.

As of the most recent reporting period, Acme Corp's provision for doubtful accounts totals $4.8M, representing 2.9% of total outstanding receivables of $163.4M, which is within the target range of 2.0% to 4.0%.
