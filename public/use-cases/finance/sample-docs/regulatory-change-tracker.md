## Active Regulatory Changes

### 1. Basel IV Implementation

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Regulation** | Basel IV (Final Basel III Reforms) |
| **Jurisdiction** | Global (implemented through national regulators) |
| **Effective Date** | Q3 2026 (EU: January 2025 phased, US: proposed Q3 2026) |
| **Status** | Impact assessment in progress |
| **Responsible Owner** | David Park, CFO |

**Summary:** Revised standardized approach for credit risk, output floor requirements, and updated operational risk framework. While Acme is not a regulated financial institution, our financial services customers are directly impacted, which affects their procurement and budgeting decisions.

**Impact Assessment:** Estimated capital increase of 8% to 12% for our banking and financial services customers. This may create headwinds for enterprise deal cycles in the financial services vertical (currently 15.7% of revenue) as customers reassess technology budgets. Conversely, demand for compliance and risk analytics tools is expected to increase, creating an upsell opportunity for our compliance module.

**Action Items:** Product team evaluating Basel IV compliance reporting features for Q2 2026 release. Sales enablement materials in development for financial services vertical team. Customer advisory board session scheduled for February 2026.

### 2. DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Regulation** | EU Regulation 2022/2554 (DORA) |
| **Jurisdiction** | European Union |
| **Effective Date** | January 17, 2025 |
| **Status** | Compliance verification ongoing |
| **Responsible Owner** | Maria Santos, VP Engineering |

**Summary:** Establishes uniform requirements for ICT risk management, incident reporting, operational resilience testing, and third-party ICT service provider oversight for financial entities in the EU.

**Impact on Acme:** As an ICT service provider to EU financial entities, Acme must support customers' DORA compliance obligations. Requirements include: enhanced incident reporting (major ICT incidents within 4 hours), contractual provisions for audit rights and exit strategies, and participation in threat-led penetration testing (TLPT) when requested.

**Action Items:** Updated standard contract terms for EU financial services customers (completed November 2025). Incident reporting process enhanced to meet 4-hour notification requirement (completed). Third-party risk management documentation updated. Annual resilience testing program expanded to include DORA-specific scenarios.

### 3. SEC Climate Disclosure Rules

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Regulation** | SEC Climate-Related Disclosure Requirements |
| **Jurisdiction** | United States |
| **Effective Date** | Pending (final rule adopted March 2024, compliance phased, litigation ongoing) |
| **Status** | Monitoring, voluntary reporting initiated |
| **Responsible Owner** | Jennifer Walsh, General Counsel |

**Summary:** Requires public companies to disclose climate-related risks, governance, strategy, and greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2, and for certain filers, Scope 3) in SEC filings.

**Impact on Acme:** As a NASDAQ-listed company, Acme would be required to report Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in annual filings. Scope 3 reporting requirements depend on final rule interpretation and materiality determination. Estimated incremental compliance cost: $2.5M to $4.0M annually for data collection, assurance, and reporting infrastructure.

**Action Items:** Voluntary Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting initiated in FY 2025 ESG report (limited assurance by Deloitte). Scope 3 emissions inventory underway for Category 1 (purchased goods), Category 6 (business travel), and Category 11 (use of sold products). External reporting readiness assessment scheduled for Q1 2026. Budget request for climate disclosure compliance included in FY2026 plan.

### 4. Corporate Transparency Act (Beneficial Ownership)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Regulation** | Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) |
| **Jurisdiction** | United States |
| **Effective Date** | January 1, 2024 (reporting requirements phased) |
| **Status** | Compliance completed |
| **Responsible Owner** | Jennifer Walsh, General Counsel |

**Summary:** Requires certain companies to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. Existing companies created before January 1, 2024 must file by January 1, 2025. New companies must file within 90 days of formation.

**Impact on Acme:** As a publicly traded company, Acme is exempt from direct CTA reporting requirements. However, our subsidiary entities (Acme Corp UK Ltd, Acme Corp GmbH, Acme Labs Inc.) required assessment. International subsidiaries are not subject to CTA; Acme Labs Inc. qualifies for the large company exemption.

**Action Items:** Exemption analysis documented (completed August 2024). Monitoring for changes to exemption criteria. Customer impact assessment: our financial services customers may require vendor certification of CTA compliance status. Standard response prepared for customer due diligence questionnaires.

### 5. AI Regulation (EU AI Act and Emerging U.S. Frameworks)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Regulation** | EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), NIST AI RMF, State-level AI legislation |
| **Jurisdiction** | EU, United States (federal and state) |
| **Effective Date** | EU: phased August 2024 through August 2027. US: varies by state |
| **Status** | Gap analysis in progress |
| **Responsible Owner** | Maria Santos, VP Engineering and Jennifer Walsh, General Counsel |

**Summary:** The EU AI Act establishes a risk-based framework for AI system development and deployment. Prohibited AI practices take effect February 2025. High-risk AI system requirements take effect August 2026. The U.S. lacks comprehensive federal legislation but NIST AI RMF provides voluntary guidance, and several states (Colorado, Illinois, California) have enacted or proposed AI-specific legislation.

**Impact on Acme:** Our AI insights engine and predictive analytics features likely fall under "limited risk" classification in the EU AI Act (transparency obligations, but not high-risk). However, customer use of these features in high-risk domains (credit scoring, employment decisions) could trigger high-risk requirements that flow back to us as the provider.

**Action Items:** AI system inventory and risk classification underway (target completion: Q1 2026). Model documentation and transparency requirements being integrated into product development lifecycle. AI ethics review board established (October 2025) with quarterly review of AI feature releases. Customer-facing AI usage guidelines in development to clarify shared responsibility model. Budget allocation of $1.5M for AI governance tooling and compliance processes.
