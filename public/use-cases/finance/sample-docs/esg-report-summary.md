## Environmental

### Carbon Emissions

Acme Corp is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. As a SaaS company, our emissions profile is dominated by cloud infrastructure energy consumption (Scope 2) and business travel (Scope 3, Category 6).

**Emissions Summary (metric tons CO2e):**

| Scope | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scope 1 (direct) | 840 | 920 | -8.7% |
| Scope 2 (electricity, market-based) | 11,560 | 13,200 | -12.4% |
| Total Scope 1 + 2 | 12,400 | 14,120 | -12.2% |
| Scope 3 (business travel) | 3,200 | 2,800 | +14.3% |

**Targets:** 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 (baseline: 2022, 18,400 tCO2e). Current trajectory is on track, with 32.6% reduction achieved through FY 2025.

**Renewable Energy:** 78% of electricity consumption sourced from renewable energy, up from 65% in FY 2024. Achieved through a combination of direct procurement (solar PPA for San Francisco headquarters), renewable energy certificates (RECs) for office locations, and cloud provider renewable commitments (AWS, which has committed to 100% renewable energy by 2025).

**Data Center Efficiency:** Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) for our co-located infrastructure improved to 1.18 from 1.24, driven by workload optimization and migration to more efficient AWS instance types.

### Waste and Water

Office waste diversion rate: 72% (target: 80% by 2027). Water consumption is not material to our operations but is tracked at office facilities. E-waste recycling program processed 4.2 metric tons of equipment through certified recyclers.

## Social
