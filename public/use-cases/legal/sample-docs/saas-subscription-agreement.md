1.4 **Documentation.** Provider shall make available to Customer online documentation describing the features and functionality of the Service ("Documentation"). Provider may update the Documentation from time to time to reflect changes in the Service.

## 2. Service Levels

2.1 **Uptime Commitment.** Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Service available at least ninety-nine point nine percent (99.9%) of the time during each calendar month, measured on a twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week basis, excluding Scheduled Maintenance ("Uptime Commitment").

2.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Provider shall perform routine maintenance during designated maintenance windows, typically between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM Pacific Time on Sundays. Provider shall provide at least forty-eight (48) hours' advance notice of any Scheduled Maintenance expected to result in Service unavailability.

2.3 **Service Credits.** If Provider fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in any calendar month, Customer shall be eligible for service credits as follows: (a) for monthly uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%, a credit equal to ten percent (10%) of the monthly subscription fee; (b) for monthly uptime between 95.0% and 99.0%, a credit equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the monthly subscription fee; and (c) for monthly uptime below 95.0%, a credit equal to fifty percent (50%) of the monthly subscription fee.

2.4 **Credit Request.** To receive a service credit, Customer must submit a written request to Provider within thirty (30) days of the end of the calendar month in which the Uptime Commitment was not met.

## 3. Data Handling

3.1 **Customer Data.** As between the Parties, Customer retains all right, title, and interest in and to all data, content, and information submitted by Customer or its users to the Service ("Customer Data"). Provider shall not access, use, or process Customer Data except as necessary to provide the Service or as otherwise instructed by Customer.

3.2 **Data Security.** Provider shall implement and maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect Customer Data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Such safeguards shall be no less protective than industry-standard practices for similarly situated service providers.

3.4 **Data Backup.** Provider shall perform daily backups of Customer Data and shall retain such backups for a minimum of thirty (30) days. In the event of data loss, Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore Customer Data from the most recent available backup.

5.2 **Auto-Renewal.** Unless either Party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term, the subscription shall automatically renew for successive periods equal in length to the Initial Term (each, a "Renewal Term"), at Provider's then-current list prices unless otherwise agreed in writing.

5.3 **Termination for Cause.** Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other Party: (a) materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice; or (b) becomes subject to any proceeding under bankruptcy or insolvency law.

5.4 **Suspension.** Provider may suspend Customer's access to the Service immediately upon written notice if: (a) Customer's account is more than thirty (30) days past due; (b) Customer's use of the Service poses a security risk to Provider or any third party; or (c) Customer's use of the Service may subject Provider to legal liability.

5.5 **Data Export.** Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Provider shall make Customer Data available for export in a standard, machine-readable format for a period of thirty (30) days. After such period, Provider shall delete all Customer Data in accordance with its standard data deletion procedures.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

6.1 **Limitation of Damages.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6.2 **Cap on Liability.** EXCEPT FOR A PARTY'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, OR CUSTOMER'S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, EACH PARTY'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

6.3 **Essential Basis.** THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6 ARE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH LIMITATIONS, THE ECONOMIC TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT.

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF,** the Parties have executed this SaaS Subscription Agreement as of the Effective Date.
