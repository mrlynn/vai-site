## 1. Overview

1.1 This document provides an analysis of the limitation of liability provisions incorporated into Acme Corp's ("the Company") standard contract templates. These provisions are designed to allocate risk between the parties in a manner that is commercially reasonable and consistent with industry practice for software-as-a-service agreements.

1.2 Limitation of liability clauses serve two primary functions: they establish a maximum aggregate cap on recoverable direct damages, and they exclude certain categories of consequential, incidental, and indirect damages. Together, these provisions create a predictable risk framework for both the Company and its customers.

1.3 The provisions described herein are subject to negotiation on a case-by-case basis, particularly for enterprise agreements. Any deviations from the standard terms require approval from the Legal Department.

## 2. Direct Damages Cap

2.1 Under the Company's standard Master Subscription Agreement ("MSA"), the total aggregate liability of either party for all claims arising out of or related to the agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid or payable by the customer to the Company during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

2.2 This cap applies to all causes of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal theory. The cap is cumulative, meaning that multiple claims shall not enlarge the limit beyond the stated aggregate amount.

2.3 For customers with annual contract values exceeding five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), the Company may negotiate an increased cap equal to two times (2x) the annual fees, subject to Legal Department approval and appropriate insurance coverage.

## 3. Consequential Damages Exclusion

3.1 Neither party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of data, loss of business opportunity, or cost of procurement of substitute services, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable and regardless of whether either party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

3.2 This exclusion applies irrespective of the legal theory upon which the claim is based, including breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, or other tortious conduct.

3.3 The Company acknowledges that certain jurisdictions may not permit the exclusion of consequential damages in all circumstances. In such cases, the exclusion shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

## 4. Exceptions to the Liability Cap

4.1 The following categories of liability are carved out from the general damages cap and consequential damages exclusion:

4.1.1 **Intellectual Property Indemnification:** Liability arising from a party's indemnification obligations with respect to claims of intellectual property infringement by a third party. The cap for IP indemnification obligations is two times (2x) the annual fees paid or payable under the agreement.

4.1.2 **Confidentiality Breach:** Liability resulting from a party's breach of its confidentiality obligations under the agreement, including unauthorized disclosure of the other party's confidential information. The cap for confidentiality-related liability is two times (2x) the annual fees.

4.1.3 **Willful Misconduct or Gross Negligence:** Liability arising from a party's willful misconduct, gross negligence, or fraud. Such liability is uncapped.

4.1.4 **Data Breach Liability:** Liability arising from the Company's failure to implement reasonable security measures resulting in a breach of customer personal data. The cap for data breach liability is three times (3x) the annual fees, subject to the Company maintaining adequate cyber liability insurance.

4.2 The specific exceptions and their corresponding sub-caps are negotiable for enterprise customers and may be adjusted based on the nature and volume of data processed under the agreement.

## 5. Insurance Requirements

5.1 The Company maintains the following insurance coverage to support its liability obligations: (a) Commercial General Liability insurance with a per-occurrence limit of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) and an aggregate limit of not less than two million dollars ($2,000,000); (b) Professional Liability (Errors and Omissions) insurance with a limit of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per claim and in the aggregate; (c) Cyber Liability insurance with a limit of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) per claim and in the aggregate.

5.2 Certificates of insurance shall be provided to customers upon written request. The Company shall provide thirty (30) days' written notice to affected customers prior to any material reduction in coverage.

## 6. Comparative Analysis Across Contract Types

6.3 **Strategic Partnership Agreement:** Direct damages capped at twenty-four (24) months of fees. Broader carve-outs including uncapped liability for willful misconduct and gross negligence. Enhanced insurance requirements. Suitable for co-development, reseller, and OEM arrangements.
