## 2. Scope of Processing

2.1 **Roles.** The Parties acknowledge that with respect to the processing of Personal Data under this DPA, Controller is the data controller and Processor is the data processor acting on behalf of Controller.

2.5 **Compliance.** Each Party shall comply with its respective obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Processor shall inform Controller if, in Processor's opinion, an instruction from Controller infringes Applicable Data Protection Laws.

## 3. Data Subject Rights

3.1 **Assistance.** Processor shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Controller by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of Controller's obligation to respond to requests from Data Subjects exercising their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws.

If no resolution can be reached, Controller may terminate the affected services without penalty.

4.4 **Sub-Processor Obligations.** Processor shall ensure that each Sub-Processor is bound by written data processing obligations that provide at least the same level of data protection as those set forth in this DPA. Processor shall remain fully liable to Controller for the performance of each Sub-Processor's obligations.
