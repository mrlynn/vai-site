2.1.3 **Legal Obligation:** Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Company is subject under EU or Member State law.

2.1.4 **Legitimate Interests:** Processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the Company, provided that such interests are not overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The Company shall document a Legitimate Interests Assessment ("LIA") for each processing activity relying on this basis.

2.2 Where special categories of data are processed (Article 9), additional conditions must be satisfied, including explicit consent or a recognized exemption.

## 3. Data Subject Rights

3.1 Acme Corp recognizes and shall facilitate the exercise of the following rights by data subjects:

3.1.1 **Right of Access (Article 15):** Data subjects may request confirmation as to whether their personal data is being processed and, if so, access to that data along with supplementary information including the purposes of processing, categories of data, and recipients.

3.1.2 **Right to Rectification (Article 16):** Data subjects may request the correction of inaccurate personal data or the completion of incomplete data without undue delay.

3.1.3 **Right to Erasure (Article 17):** Data subjects may request deletion of their personal data where the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, where consent has been withdrawn, or where processing is unlawful. This right is subject to exemptions including compliance with legal obligations and the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

3.1.4 **Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18):** Data subjects may request restriction of processing where the accuracy of data is contested, where processing is unlawful but the data subject opposes erasure, or where the Company no longer needs the data but the data subject requires it for legal claims.

3.1.5 **Right to Data Portability (Article 20):** Data subjects have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit that data to another controller without hindrance.

3.1.6 **Right to Object (Article 21):** Data subjects may object to processing based on legitimate interests or direct marketing at any time. The Company shall cease processing unless it demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds that override the interests of the data subject.

3.2 Acme Corp shall respond to all valid data subject requests within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt, with the possibility of a sixty (60) day extension for complex or voluminous requests, provided the data subject is informed of the extension and the reasons for it.

## 4. Data Protection Officer

4.2 The DPO is responsible for monitoring internal compliance, advising on data protection impact assessments, cooperating with the supervisory authority, and serving as a point of contact for data subjects.

## 6. Data Protection Impact Assessment

6.1 Acme Corp shall conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment ("DPIA") prior to any processing that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, as required by Article 35.

6.2 A DPIA is mandatory where processing involves systematic and extensive profiling with significant effects, large-scale processing of special categories of data, or systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas.

6.3 Where a DPIA indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of mitigating measures, Acme Corp shall consult the supervisory authority under Article 36 prior to commencing the processing.
