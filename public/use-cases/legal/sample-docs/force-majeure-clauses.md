## 1. Definition

1.1 A "Force Majeure Event" means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the affected party that prevents, hinders, or delays that party's performance of its obligations under the agreement, provided that the affected party could not have reasonably anticipated the event at the time of entering into the agreement and could not have reasonably avoided or overcome its effects.

1.2 The determination of whether an event constitutes a Force Majeure Event shall be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the nature of the obligation affected, the duration and severity of the event, and the geographic scope of its impact.

1.3 The burden of proving the existence and impact of a Force Majeure Event rests with the party claiming relief under this provision.

## 2. Qualifying Events

2.1 The following events shall constitute Force Majeure Events, provided they satisfy the general requirements set forth in Section 1:

2.1.1 **Natural Disasters:** Earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, wildfires, and other acts of nature of extraordinary severity that materially impair the affected party's ability to perform.

2.1.2 **Pandemic or Epidemic:** Outbreaks of infectious disease declared as a pandemic or public health emergency by the World Health Organization or a comparable governmental authority, to the extent that such outbreak materially impairs the affected party's workforce, supply chain, or operational infrastructure.

2.1.3 **Government Action:** Embargoes, sanctions, trade restrictions, quarantine orders, government-mandated shutdowns, changes in law or regulation, or any act or omission of a governmental authority that renders performance illegal, impracticable, or commercially unreasonable.

2.1.4 **Armed Conflict:** War (whether declared or undeclared), invasion, armed conflict, terrorism, insurrection, civil unrest, or military action that materially affects the geographic region in which the affected party operates.

2.1.5 **Cyberattack:** A large-scale cyberattack, including distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, or state-sponsored cyber operations, that targets critical infrastructure or third-party service providers upon which the affected party materially depends, provided that the affected party maintained commercially reasonable cybersecurity measures prior to the attack.

2.1.6 **Infrastructure Failure:** Widespread failure of telecommunications networks, power grids, or internet infrastructure caused by events outside the affected party's control, excluding failures attributable to the affected party's own systems or service providers within its direct control.

## 3. Exclusions

3.1 The following events shall not constitute Force Majeure Events:

3.1.1 Economic hardship, market fluctuations, changes in exchange rates, or increases in the cost of raw materials or labor, even where such events make performance more expensive or less profitable than anticipated.

3.1.2 Failure of the affected party's subcontractors or service providers to perform, unless such failure is itself caused by a qualifying Force Majeure Event.

3.1.3 Strikes, lockouts, or other labor disputes affecting only the affected party's workforce, unless such dispute is part of a broader industry-wide or nationwide action.

3.1.4 Events that were reasonably foreseeable at the time of execution of the agreement, including seasonal weather patterns, known regulatory changes, and pre-existing geopolitical conditions.

3.1.5 The affected party's failure to implement reasonable business continuity or disaster recovery plans.

## 4. Notice Requirements

4.1 The affected party shall provide written notice to the other party within five (5) business days of becoming aware of a Force Majeure Event that may affect its ability to perform. The notice shall include: (a) a description of the event and its expected impact on performance; (b) the specific obligations affected; (c) the estimated duration of the impairment; and (d) the steps being taken to mitigate the effects of the event.

4.2 The affected party shall provide periodic updates, no less frequently than every fourteen (14) calendar days, regarding the status of the Force Majeure Event and its continued impact on performance.

4.3 Failure to provide timely notice shall not automatically disqualify a party from claiming relief under this provision, but may be considered as a factor in assessing the reasonableness of the party's response and the extent of available relief.

## 5. Mitigation Obligations

5.1 The affected party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and to resume performance of its obligations as soon as practicable. Such efforts may include activating business continuity plans, engaging alternative suppliers or service providers, or implementing temporary workarounds.

5.2 The affected party's obligation to mitigate does not require it to incur disproportionate costs or to take actions that would be commercially unreasonable under the circumstances.

5.3 Both parties shall cooperate in good faith to identify and implement measures that minimize the disruption caused by the Force Majeure Event.

## 6. Effect on Performance

6.1 To the extent that performance is prevented or delayed by a Force Majeure Event, the affected party's obligation to perform shall be suspended for the duration of the event, and the time for performance shall be extended by a period equal to the duration of the delay.

6.2 The non-affected party's corresponding obligations (including, without limitation, payment obligations) shall be equitably adjusted during the period of suspension, to the extent that such obligations relate to the suspended performance.

6.3 A Force Majeure Event shall not excuse: (a) payment obligations for services already rendered prior to the event; (b) obligations of confidentiality; or (c) obligations relating to data protection and security.

## 7. Extended Force Majeure and Termination

7.1 If a Force Majeure Event continues for a period exceeding ninety (90) consecutive calendar days, either party may terminate the affected portion of the agreement (or the agreement in its entirety, if the Force Majeure Event materially affects the whole of the agreement) by providing thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party.

7.2 Upon termination under this Section, neither party shall have further liability to the other, except for: (a) payment of fees for services rendered prior to the termination date; (b) return or destruction of confidential information; and (c) any obligations that by their nature are intended to survive termination.

7.3 The Company shall provide a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees covering the period after the termination date.

7.4 Termination under this provision shall be without prejudice to any rights or remedies that accrued prior to the date of termination.
