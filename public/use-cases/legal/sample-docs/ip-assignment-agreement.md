WHEREAS, Assignor is or will be engaged by the Company as an employee, consultant, or contractor; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

## 1. Assignment of Work Product

1.1 Assignor hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to the Company all right, title, and interest in and to any and all Work Product. "Work Product" means all inventions, discoveries, improvements, designs, works of authorship, software, code, algorithms, documentation, data, trade secrets, trademarks, and any other intellectual property or materials created, developed, conceived, reduced to practice, or contributed by Assignor, whether solely or jointly with others, that: (a) are made or conceived during the period of Assignor's engagement with the Company; (b) relate to the Company's actual or anticipated business, research, or development activities; or (c) are developed using the Company's resources, equipment, facilities, or Confidential Information.

1.2 This assignment includes all rights under patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and any other intellectual property laws in all jurisdictions worldwide, including the right to file, prosecute, and maintain applications for registration of such rights.

1.3 To the extent that any Work Product qualifies as a "work made for hire" under applicable copyright law, it shall be deemed a work made for hire, and the Company shall be considered the author thereof. To the extent that any Work Product does not qualify as a work made for hire, Assignor hereby assigns all copyright therein to the Company.

1.4 Assignor agrees to promptly disclose to the Company in writing all Work Product, whether or not Assignor believes such Work Product is subject to this Agreement.

2.2 If no Prior Inventions are listed on Schedule A, Assignor represents that no such Prior Inventions exist as of the Effective Date.

2.3 If Assignor incorporates any Prior Inventions into any Work Product, Assignor hereby grants the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and create derivative works of such Prior Inventions as incorporated into or used in connection with the Work Product.

2.4 Assignor shall not incorporate any Prior Inventions into Work Product without the Company's prior written consent.

## 3. Moral Rights Waiver

3.1 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Assignor hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any and all moral rights that Assignor may have in or with respect to any Work Product, including the right of attribution, the right to the integrity of the work, and the right to object to modifications or derogatory treatment of the work.

3.2 In jurisdictions where moral rights cannot be waived, Assignor agrees not to exercise such rights against the Company or its successors, assigns, or licensees, and Assignor consents to any action by the Company that would otherwise constitute an infringement of Assignor's moral rights.

3.3 Assignor agrees that the Company may use, modify, adapt, and distribute Work Product without attribution to Assignor, and Assignor waives any right to require that Assignor's name or likeness be associated with any Work Product.

## 4. Cooperation

This obligation includes, without limitation: (a) executing patent, copyright, and trademark applications and assignments; (b) providing declarations, affidavits, and testimony; (c) producing documents and evidence; and (d) performing any other acts reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

4.2 Assignor's obligation to cooperate under this Section shall survive the termination of Assignor's engagement with the Company and shall continue for so long as may be necessary to protect the Company's intellectual property rights.

4.3 The Company shall reimburse Assignor for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing cooperation after the termination of Assignor's engagement, provided that such expenses are approved by the Company in advance.

4.4 If Assignor is unable or unwilling to execute any document or perform any act required under this Section, Assignor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its authorized officers and agents as Assignor's attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, to execute such documents and perform such acts on Assignor's behalf. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive Assignor's disability or incapacity.
